In simple words, ML\nteaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from\nthe data.\nIt can be broadly categorized into four types:\nTypes of Machine Learning\nSupervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify\nnew, unseen data.\nUnsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like\nclustering or dimensionality reduction.\nReinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize\nrewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.\nNote: Self-supervised learning is not one of the original three, but it\nhas become a major category in deep learning and fields like NLP and\ncomputer vision.\nSemi-Supervised Learning: The model generates its own labels from\nthe data, so we don’t need human-annotated labels.\nPython for Machine Learning\nMachine Learning with R\nMachine Learning Algorithms\nEDA\nMath for Mach\nSearch...\nWe use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website.

ML workflow\n2. Data Cleaning\n3. Feature Scaling\n4. Data Preprocessing in Python\nModule 2: Supervised Learning\nSupervised learning\xa0algorithms are generally categorized into\xa0two main\ntypes:\xa0\nClassification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories\xa0\nRegression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values.\nSupervised Learning\nThere are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to\ndifferent types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised\nlearning algorithms are:\n1. Linear Regression\nThis is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It\nhelps find the relationship between input and output.\nIntroduction to Linear Regression\nGradient Descent in Linear Regression\nWe use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website.

Logistic Regression\nUsed when the output is a "yes or no" type answer. It helps in predicting\ncategories like pass/fail or spam/not spam.\nUnderstanding Logistic Regression\nCost function in Logistic Regression\n3. Decision Trees\nA model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a\nflowchart. Easy to understand and use.\nDecision Tree in Machine Learning\nTypes of Decision tree algorithms\nDecision Tree - Regression (Implementation)\nDecision tree - Classification (Implementation)\n4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\nA bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate\ndifferent categories of data.\nUnderstanding SVMs\nSVM Hyperparameter Tuning - GridSearchCV\nNon-Linear SVM\n5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)\nThis model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions.\nSuper simple and based on similarity.\nIntroduction to KNN\nDecision Boundaries in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n6.

Mental health care professionals can help people\nmanage conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar\ndisorder, addiction, and other disorders that affect their\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\nMental health can affect a person’s day-to-day life, relationships, and\nphysical health. External factors in people’s lives and relationships can\nalso contribute to their mental well-being.\nLooking after one’s mental health can help a person maintain their ability\nto enjoy life. This involves balancing their activities, responsibilities, and\nefforts to achieve psychological resilience.\nStress, depression, and anxiety can affect mental health and may disrupt\na person’s routine.\nAlthough healthcare professionals often use the term “mental health,”\ndoctors recognize that many mental health conditions have physical\nroots.\nThis article explains what mental health and mental health conditions\nmean. It also describes the most common types of mental health\ndisorders, including their early signs and how to treat them.\nDefinition\nRisk factors\nTypes of disorders\nEarly signs\nDiagnosis\nTreatment\nMyths vs. facts\nOutlook\nAdditional steps\nSummary\nADVERTISEMENT\n\ue90c\nADVERTISEMENT\nSUBSCRIBE\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n1/21\nChelsea Victoria/Stocksy\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) \ue90f:\n“Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people\nto cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well\nand work well, and contribute to their community.”\nThe WHO states that mental health is “more than the absence of mental\ndisorders.” Peak mental health is about managing active conditions and\nmaintaining wellness and happiness.\nThe organization also emphasizes that preserving and restoring mental\nhealth is important at individual, community, and societal levels.\nThe WHO definition of mental health\n\ue90c\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n2/21\nIn the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that\nalmost 1 in 5 adults experience mental health problems each year.\nIn 2021, an estimated 14.1 million adults \ue90f in the U.S., about 5.5% of the\nadult population, had a serious psychological condition, according to the\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).\nEveryone is at some risk of developing a mental health disorder,\nregardless of age, sex, income, or ethnicity. In the U.S. and much of the\ndeveloped world, depression is one of the leading causes \ue90f of disability.\nSocial and financial circumstances, adverse childhood experiences,\nbiological factors, and underlying medical conditions can all \ue90f shape a\nperson’s mental well-being.\nMany people with a mental health disorder have more than one \ue90f\ncondition at the same time.\nIt is important to note that mental well-being depends on a balance of\nfactors, and several elements may contribute to the development of a\nmental health disorder.\nThe following factors can contribute to mental health conditions.\nSocioeconomic pressure\nHaving limited financial means or belonging to a marginalized ethnic\ngroup can increase the risk of mental health disorders as a result of\nbiases in healthcare.\nA 2015 Iranian study \ue90f describes several socioeconomic causes of mental\nhealth conditions, including poverty and living on the outskirts of a large\ncity.\nThe researchers also described flexible (modifiable) and inflexible\n(nonmodifiable) factors that can affect the availability and quality of mental\nhealth care treatment for certain groups.\nModifiable factors for mental health disorders include:\nRisk factors for mental health conditions\n\ue90c\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n3/21\nsocioeconomic conditions, such as whether work is available in a\nlocal area\noccupation\na person’s level of social involvement\neducation\nhousing quality\nNonmodifiable factors include:\ngender\nage\nethnicity\nnationality\nThe researchers found that being female increased the risk of low mental\nhealth status by nearly four times. People with a “weak economic status”\nscored highest for mental health conditions in this study.\nChildhood adversity\nSeveral studies \ue90f report that childhood traumas such as child abuse,\nparental loss, parental separation, and parental illness significantly affect\na growing child’s mental and physical health.\nThere are associations between childhood abuse and other adverse\nevents and mental health disorders. These experiences also make people\nvulnerable to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nBiological factors\nThe NIMH suggests that a person’s family history can increase the\nlikelihood \ue90f of mental health conditions, as specific genes and gene\nvariants put a person at higher risk. However, having a gene associated\nwith a mental health disorder does not guarantee that a condition will\ndevelop.\nLikewise, people without related genes or a family history of mental\nhealth conditions may have a mental health disorder.\n\ue90c\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n4/21\nChronic stress and mental health disorders such as depression and\nanxiety may develop due to underlying physical health problems, such as\ncancer, diabetes, and chronic pain.\nMental health resources\nVisit our dedicated hub for more research-backed information\nand resources on mental health and well-being.\nHealthcare professionals group mental health disorders according to the\nfeatures they have in common.

A person with GAD may sometimes feel anxiety with no\ntrigger at all.\nPanic disorder\nPeople with panic disorder experience regular panic attacks involving\nsudden, overwhelming terror or a sense of imminent disaster and death.\nPhobias\nThere are many types of phobias, and what may seem typical to one\nperson might be a severe problem that dominates daily life for another.\nDifferent types include:\nSimple phobias: These may involve a disproportionate fear of\nspecific objects, scenarios, or animals. A fear of spiders is a typical\nexample.\nSocial phobia: Sometimes known as social anxiety, this is a fear of\nbeing watched or judged by others.

People sometimes misunderstand this phobia as a\nfear of being outside.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder\nPeople with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may experience\nconstant, stressful thoughts and an urge to perform repetitive acts, such\nas handwashing.\nPTSD\nPTSD can occur after a person experiences or witnesses a stressful or\ntraumatic event. During this type of event, the person thinks their life or\nother people’s lives are in danger. They may feel afraid or that they have\nno control over what is happening.\nThese sensations of trauma and fear may then contribute to PTSD.\nMood disorders\nPeople may also refer to mood disorders as affective disorders or\ndepressive disorders.\nPeople with these conditions have significant mood changes, generally\ninvolving either mania, a period of high energy and joy, or depression.\nExamples of mood disorders include:\nMajor depression: An individual with major depression experiences\na constant low mood and loses interest in activities and events that\nthey previously enjoyed (anhedonia). They may feel prolonged\nperiods of sadness or extreme sadness.\nBipolar disorder: A person with bipolar disorder experiences\nunusual changes \ue90f in their mood, energy levels, levels of activity,\nand ability to continue with daily life. Periods of high mood are\nknown as manic phases, while depressive phases bring on low\nmood.\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD): Reduced daylight during the fall,\nwinter, and early spring months triggers SAD, a type of major\ndepression \ue90f.

A person will have thoughts that appear\nfragmented, and may also find it hard to process information.\nSchizophrenia has negative and positive symptoms. Positive symptoms\ninclude delusions, thought disorders, and hallucinations, while withdrawal,\nlack of motivation, and a flat or inappropriate mood are examples of\nnegative symptoms.\nNo physical test or scan reliably indicates whether a person has\ndeveloped a mental health condition. However, people should look out\nfor the following as possible signs:\nwithdrawing from friends, family, and colleagues\navoiding activities they would usually enjoy\nsleeping too much or too little\neating too much or too little\nfeeling hopeless\nhaving consistently low energy\nusing mood-altering substances, including alcohol and nicotine,\nmore frequently\ndisplaying negative emotions\nbeing confused\nbeing unable to complete daily tasks, such as getting to work or\ncooking a meal\nhaving persistent thoughts or memories that reappear regularly\nthinking of causing physical harm to themselves or others\nEarly signs\n\ue90c\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n8/21\nhearing voices\nexperiencing delusions\nDiagnosing a mental health disorder requires a multistep process.
