Heatwaves \ncontributed to high growth in electricity demand which resulted in a \nsmall increase in fossil generation, driving up power sector emissions to \nan all-time high.\nSolar power has become the engine of the global energy transition, with both solar \ngeneration and capacity installations setting new records in 2024. Solar generation has \nmaintained its high growth rate, doubling in the last three years, and adding more electricity \nthan any other source over that period. At the same time, electricity demand saw a \nsignificant rise in 2024, outpacing the growth in clean electricity. Expanding technologies \nsuch as AI, data centres, electric vehicles and heat pumps are already contributing to the \nrise in global demand. However, the main reason why electricity demand growth was \nelevated in 2024 compared to 2023 was an increase in air conditioning use during \nheatwaves. This accounted for almost all of the small rise in fossil generation. \nWorld surpasses 40% clean \npower as renewables see \nrecord rise\n5\n6\nClean power surpasses 40% of global electricity generation\nGeneration from all low-carbon power sources – renewables plus nuclear – \nsurpassed 40% of global electricity in 2024 for the first time since the 1940s. \nRenewable power sources added a record 858 TWh of generation in 2024, 49% more \nthan the previous record of 577 TWh set in 2022. The record increase in renewables \ncoupled with a small increase in nuclear output of 69 TWh brought low-carbon power \nto 40.9% (12,609 TWh) of the mix in 2024, compared with 39.4% in 2023. Hydro \nremained the largest source of low-carbon electricity (14.3%), followed by nuclear \n(9.0%), with wind (8.1%) and solar (6.9%) rapidly gaining ground and together \novertaking hydro in 2024, while nuclear’s share reached a 45-year low. \n01\nKey takeaways\nSolar generation doubles in three years\nSolar generation has doubled over the last three years to reach over 2000 TWh. \nSolar was the largest source of new electricity generation globally for the third \nyear in a row (+474 TWh) and the fastest growing source of electricity (+29%) for \nthe 20th year in a row. More than half (53%) of the increase in solar generation in \n2024 was in China, with China’s clean generation growth meeting 81% of its \ndemand increase in 2024. The fast pace of global solar growth is set to continue, \nwith 2024 setting a new record for solar capacity installations in a single year – \nmore than double the amount installed in 2022. Global solar power capacity \nreached 1 TW in 2022 after decades of growth, but reached 2 TW only two years \nlater, in 2024.\n02\nHeatwaves the main driver of a small increase in fossil \ngeneration\nPeriods of hotter temperatures around population centres drove up demand for \ncooling in 2024 compared with 2023. This added 0.7% (+208 TWh) to global \nelectricity demand, and meant that overall demand grew by much more (+4.0%) \nthan in 2023 (+2.6%). Consequently fossil generation increased by 1.4%, and global \npower sector emissions rose by 1.6% to a new all-time high of 14.6 billion tonnes of \nCO2. Hotter temperatures were the main driver of the rise in fossil generation: \nwithout this, fossil generation would have risen by only 0.2%, as clean electricity \ngeneration met 96% of the demand growth not caused by hotter temperatures. \nThe increase in global fossil generation in 2024 (+245 TWh) was virtually identical \nto that seen in 2023 (+246 TWh) despite the substantial difference in rates of \ndemand growth. \n03\n7\nThe global power system will be dominated by two mega-trends over the rest of the decade: \nsolar’s share in the electricity mix rising rapidly as it continues its exponential growth, and \nrobust electricity demand growth as electricity replaces other forms of energy powering the \nglobal economy. \nSigns of this are already here: solar has been the largest source of new electricity for the last \nthree years, and new drivers of demand such as EVs, heat pumps and data centres are \ncontributing 0.7% to annual demand growth, more than twice as much as they did five years \nago. \n8\nAs we reach a tipping point where the increasingly rapid rise of clean generation outpaces \nstructural growth in demand, changes to fossil fuel generation over the short-term will be \ndominated by fluctuations in weather, as seen in 2024 with the impacts of heatwaves. \nDespite this, it remains clear that clean generation growth and the uptake of flexible \ntechnologies such as battery storage will reduce reliance on fossil fuel power in the coming \nyears, even in a world of faster demand growth. \nWe estimate that even if electricity demand grows at 4.1% per year until 2030, which exceeds \ncurrent expectations, clean generation growth will be fast enough to keep pace. Dynamics in \nthe world’s largest emerging economies will play a crucial role. China and India are both \nmoving towards a future of demand growth powered by clean electricity, helping to tip the \nbalance towards a decline in fossil generation at a global level.\n\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition. Paired with \nbattery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and \nlargest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world’s ever-increasing \ndemand for electricity.\nAmid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil \ngeneration increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\nThe world is watching how technologies like AI and EVs will drive electricity demand. \nIt’s clear that booming solar and wind are comfortably set to deliver, and those \nexpecting fossil fuel generation to keep rising will be disappointed.\nCleantech, not fossil fuels, is now the driving force of economic development. The era \nof fossil growth is coming to an end, even in a world of fast-rising demand.”\nPhil MacDonald\nManaging Director, Ember\nChapter 1: 2024 in review\nRecord renewables growth helped push clean power to a new \nmilestone. However, heatwaves contributed to high growth in electricity \ndemand, which resulted in a small increase in fossil generation.\nRenewable generation showed a record increase in 2024, driven by a surge in solar power, a \nrebound in hydro and moderate wind growth. Hotter temperatures than in 2023 amplified \nthe increase in electricity demand and led to a small rise in fossil generation (+1.4%). \nConsequently, power sector emissions increased by 1.6%, rising to a new record high of 14.6 \nbillion tonnes of CO2. However, fossil generation would have remained almost unchanged in \nthe absence of hotter temperatures, as clean generation rose quickly enough to meet the \nnon-temperature related growth in electricity demand in 2024.\nRecord rise in renewables, led by solar, brings clean power to a new \nmilestone\nClean power surpasses 40% of global electricity generation\nA record surge in renewables spearheaded by solar power, combined with increased \nnuclear output, pushed clean electricity's share to 40.9% of global electricity in 2024, up from \n39.4% in 2023. 2024 was the first year that low-carbon sources delivered more than 40% of \nglobal electricity since the 1940s, when the global electricity system was 50 times smaller \nthan it is today.\nRecord rise in renewables \npushes clean power generation \nabove 40% of global electricity\n9\nThe global share of wind (8.1%) and solar (6.9%) is rapidly increasing, together exceeding \nhydropower for the first time in 2024. Hydro remained the largest source of clean electricity, \nproviding 14.3% of global electricity generation in 2024, followed by nuclear at 9.0%. Despite \nremaining the two largest sources of low-carbon electricity, hydro and nuclear are not \nincreasing their share – with nuclear's share falling to a 45-year low in 2024 – as generation \nhas been growing more slowly than electricity demand.\nOther renewables, such as bioenergy and geothermal power, contributed 2.6% of global \nelectricity in 2024.\n80 countries generated more than 50% of their electricity from clean sources in 2024, \nincluding 47 countries that reached more than 75%.\nAs the global share of clean sources rose, the share of fossil fuels in the electricity mix \nconsequently fell from 60.6% in 2023 to 59.1% in 2024, dropping below 60% for the first time \nsince the 1940s. Coal power provided 34.4% of global electricity in 2024 and gas 22%, with \nother fossil fuels contributing 2.8%.\n10\nRecord renewables growth meets three-quarters of electricity demand growth\nIn 2024, renewable power sources collectively added a record 858 TWh of generation – a \n49% increase over the previous record of 577 TWh set in 2022. \nWith the growth in solar, hydro and wind, renewables met three-quarters of the growth in \nelectricity demand. Solar was the largest driver of new electricity growth, rising by 474 TWh \n(+29%) and meeting 40% of the global increase in electricity demand.\nHydropower output rose by 182 TWh in 2024, reaching a new all-time high. The growth in \n2024 was a rebound from historic droughts in 2023, which constrained hydro production. \nNotably, China accounted for 72% of the rebound in global hydro generation in 2024, as the \ncountry was hit particularly hard by droughts in late 2022 and 2023. \nHowever, despite the global increase in hydro generation in 2024, the capacity factor – the \namount of generation per unit of capacity – of the global hydro fleet remained significantly \nbelow historical levels. The record generation in 2024 was only 2% above the previous record \nset in 2020, despite capacity increasing by 7% since then.\n11\nWind generation also grew by 182 TWh (+7.9%) in 2024. While capacity additions remained \nhigh, slightly lower wind speeds in some geographies – especially in China and the EU – \nreduced potential generation gains. With capacity growth remaining strong across the \nworld, generation is likely to return to higher growth in the coming years, though wind \nconditions will affect output from year to year.\nNuclear power increased by 69 TWh (+2.5%), rising for the second year in a row, driven \nlargely by higher utilisation rates in France. \nTogether, renewables and nuclear met 79% of the demand increase. Fossil fuels met the \nremainder of the demand increase, which was largely caused by hotter temperatures (see \nmore detail later in this chapter).\n12\nRecord solar increase in 2024 as solar power maintains high growth rates\nSolar power surged by a record 474 TWh in 2024, the largest annual growth ever recorded in \nabsolute terms and the fastest increase in six years (+29%). Solar power has maintained its \nextraordinarily high growth rates even as the technology has become the primary driver of \nnew electricity generation. As a result, solar generation has doubled every three years, \nreaching 2,131 TWh in 2024. For the third consecutive year, solar recorded the largest absolute \nincrease of any electricity source. For the 20th year in a row, it remained the fastest-growing \npower source.\nThe surge in 2024 was driven by record solar capacity installations in 2023 and 2024. In 2023, \nnew capacity installations jumped by 86% compared with 2022. In 2024, they increased by a \nfurther 30%, to a total of 585 GW. As capacity is installed throughout the year, a proportion of \nit only results in generation increases the following year.\n13\nSolar generation growth from the recent capacity boom was potentially even larger than \nobserved, as reporting from distributed solar, such as rooftop installations, can be \nincomplete. Ember’s data includes rooftop solar generation where possible and includes \nestimates in countries with large amounts of rooftop solar where reporting is inaccurate, but \nsome underestimation is likely.\nHotter temperatures amplify high electricity demand growth \nElectricity demand grows at the third-highest level in the last decade\nGlobal electricity demand grew by 4.0% (+1,172 TWh) in 2024, crossing 30,000 TWh total \ndemand for the first time. 2024 represents the third-highest percentage growth in electricity \ndemand in the last ten years.\nThe increase in demand in 2024 was significantly higher than in 2023 and 2022, when global \ndemand grew by 2.6% (+758 TWh) and 2.3% (+656 TWh) respectively. Unlike the post-\npandemic rebound in 2021, the increase in 2024 was not driven by an acceleration in overall \neconomic activity. GDP data shows similar rates of growth in 2024 (+3.2%) and 2023 (+3.3%), \nwhich implies that economic growth was not the driving factor behind the surge in demand \nin 2024.\n14\nHeatwaves amplify higher demand growth\nElectricity demand growth accelerated from 2.6% in 2023 to 4.0% in 2024. However, \naccounting for differences in temperatures, demand growth was the same across both \nyears at 3.3%.\nAnalysing temperature impacts on electricity demand, Ember estimates that nearly a fifth of \nthe demand increase in 2024 was temperature-related (see Methodology for more detail). \n2024 surpassed 2023 as the hottest year on record, and crucially showed especially high \ntemperatures around population centres in major economies, particularly in China, the US \nand India (read more in Ember’s analysis on heatwaves and electricity demand in these \ncountries). \n15\nHigher temperatures had a twofold effect on demand in 2024. On the one hand, they \nincreased cooling demand by 238 TWh compared to 2023. On the other hand, milder winters \nreduced the need for heating by 29 TWh. The net result was a temperature-related increase \nof 208 TWh. Had 2024 experienced the same temperature patterns as 2023, the overall \nelectricity demand growth would have been only 3.3% (+963 TWh), rather than the 4.0% \n(+1,172 TWh) observed.\nRecent years have shown how weather patterns affect electricity demand, leading to year-\nto-year variability on top of the underlying upwards trend from economic growth and \nelectrification. In 2022, colder winters than normal in the United States created additional \ndemand for heating, and summer heatwaves in the US and China amplified cooling \ndemand. In 2023, there were less dramatic weather extremes, and so less demand for \nheating or cooling. In 2024, heatwaves led to higher demand for cooling.\nAnnual demand growth in both 2024 and 2023 would have been 3.3% without temperature \nimpacts. The differences in weather patterns decreased demand growth from 2022 to 2023 \nby 186 TWh, reducing what would have been a rise of 3.3% down to the observed demand \ngrowth of 2.6%. In contrast, temperature impacts increased demand growth from 2023 to \n2024 by 208 TWh, inflating what would have been a rise of 3.3% up to the 4.0% observed.\nEven after these corrections for temperature, the underlying demand growth in 2023 and \n2024 of 3.3% was higher than the ten-year average (2013-2022) of 2.5%. This is largely driven \nby applications such as EVs, heat pumps and data centres (see Chapter 2.2 for more \nanalysis).\nHeatwaves drive a small increase in fossil use\nIn 2024, global fossil generation increased by 245 TWh (+1.4%) – comparable to the \nincreases of 246 TWh in 2023 and 201 TWh in 2022. This rise in fossil generation led to a 1.6% \nincrease in global power sector emissions (+223 million tonnes of CO2), which reached a \nrecord high of 14.6 billion tonnes of CO2. However, Ember’s analysis shows that fossil \ngeneration rose primarily as a result of hotter temperatures compared to 2023.\n16\nHotter temperatures the key driver of fossil power and emissions increases in 2024\nHotter temperatures compared to 2023 were a key reason behind the increase in fossil \ngeneration in 2024. Clean electricity generation surged by a record 927 TWh in 2024, which \nwas sufficient to cover 96% of the electricity demand growth not caused by higher \ntemperatures (+963 TWh). \nHowever, fossil fuel generation rose to meet the additional demand increase of 208 TWh \ndriven by high temperatures. This dynamic was especially pronounced in countries that \nexperienced strong heatwaves, with coal rising to meet higher demand in China and India, \nand gas rising to meet demand in the US. On a global basis, if 2024 had experienced the \nsame temperatures as 2023, fossil generation would have remained almost unchanged, \nwith just a 0.2% increase.\n17\nSmaller-than-average increase in fossil generation in China and India, while the US \nrebounds from a fall in 2023\nThe world’s three largest power consumers – China, India and the US – saw an increase in \nfossil generation in 2024, while the world’s fourth largest, the EU, saw a decline.\nChina was still the country with the largest increase in fossil generation, but – despite the \nimpacts of heatwaves – 2024’s growth of 116 TWh was less than a third of its 2023 increase \n(+367 TWh) and only half its average annual increase over the last five years (+218 TWh). \nIndia’s fossil generation grew by 67 TWh in 2024, significantly lower than the 124 TWh \nincrease recorded in 2023 and the country’s lowest increase since the rebound after the \nCovid-19 pandemic.\nDriven by a rise in electricity demand, the US also saw an increase in fossil generation (+34 \nTWh) in 2024. Gas generation rose significantly, as coal saw a moderate fall. This represents \na rebound from 2023 which saw a year-on-year decline in fossil generation amid falling \ndemand. US gas generation growth was equivalent to 57% of the global increase in gas \ngeneration in 2024. Despite record clean electricity growth, the US has now recorded an \nincrease in fossil generation in three out of the last four years. \nThe EU continued to see a fall in fossil generation (-75 TWh) in 2024. This happened despite a \nsmall increase in power demand and an increase in electricity exports, as clean electricity \ngrowth significantly outpaced demand growth.\n18\nChapter 2: The Big Picture\nThis section explores three trends that are having an outsized impact in \nshaping the global electricity transition, now and in the coming years: \nthe staggering rise of solar, the new drivers of accelerated demand \ngrowth and the trajectories of China and India. \nFirst we look at solar power, which has become the engine of the global energy transition, \ndoubling every three years to become the largest and fastest-growing source of new \nelectricity generation. As battery costs decline, the combination of batteries and solar is \nproving a winning combination, along with other forms of clean flexibility that will unlock the \nfull value of solar.\nWe then discuss how emerging drivers like EVs, heat pumps and data centres have \nstructurally raised demand growth. While expectations for future growth in power \nconsumption have increased, the outlook remains uncertain. Clean generation is still \nexpected to grow quickly enough to meet higher demand growth, but fossil power declines \nwill remain unpredictable in the short-term.\nThe mega-trends \nshaping the \nelectricity transition \n19\nFinally, we turn our focus to the two countries with the largest growth in electricity demand in \nthe last two decades: China and India. The two economies are breaking the long-standing \nlink between electricity demand growth and fossil fuel expansion in the power sector by \ndeploying clean generation at a world-leading scale. Together, their progress in clean power \ncan tip the balance towards a global decline in fossil generation.\nChapter contents\n2.1 Solar is surging – flexibility can take it to the next level \n21\n2.2 Clean generation is expected to meet higher levels of demand growth \n31\n2.3 Future electricity demand growth in India and China will be powered by \nclean sources \n38\n20\nSolar surpassed 2,000 TWh of global generation in 2024, reaching this \nlevel faster than any other generation technology in history. This is \nreducing the need for additional fossil generation, enhancing energy \nsecurity in countries reliant on fossil imports. As its exponential rise \ncontinues, doubling every three years, solar power is taking off in power \nsystems all around the world and entering new markets. Combined with \nbattery storage, which almost doubled in capacity last year, countries \ncan unlock further benefits from low-cost solar power and enable fast \ngrowth to continue.\nSolar power has become the engine of the global energy transition\nCheap solar power is already reshaping the electricity system\nIn 2024, for the first time, solar power supplied more than 2,000 TWh of electricity, increasing \nby 474 TWh (+29%) from the previous year. This was the largest increase in generation from \nany power source in 2024. Solar has now been the largest source of new electricity globally \nfor three years in a row.\nHaving grown from 100 TWh to 1,000 TWh in eight years, solar generation made the jump \nfrom 1,000 TWh to 2,000 TWh in just three years. This means that it has continued its \nexponential rate of growth, doubling every three years.\n21\n2.1 \nSolar is surging – flexibility \n \n \ncan take it to the next level\nRapid solar growth is helping the world meet growing electricity demand and avoiding the \nuse of more expensive fossil fuels. Global solar generation is now large enough to power all \nof India. Without the 2,131 TWh that solar power provides, global fossil generation would be \n12% higher than it is today. In 2024, generation from solar avoided an estimated 1,658 million \ntonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) of emissions - equivalent to the United States’ power sector \nemissions.\nWhile the expansion of solar has contributed to falls in fossil generation in advanced \neconomies such as the EU and the United States, the largest avoided fossil generation is in \nChina, where annual coal generation would have been an estimated 783 TWh higher in 2024 \nif not for the build-out of solar power. In particular, the rise in coal generation in China seen \nin the last five years would have been an estimated 50% larger without the growth in solar \ngeneration.\n22\nRecord capacity installations keep driving solar to new heights\nIncreases in generation have been achieved thanks to the pace of capacity additions. The \nworld installed a record 585 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity last year - 30% more than in \n2023, and more than double the amount installed in 2022. Having surpassed 1 TW of solar \npower in 2022, it took only two years to install the next 1 TW.\nThis is not just unprecedented for solar power - it is a rate of growth that no power source \nhas seen before. In fact, the solar capacity installed in 2024 is more than the annual capacity \ninstallations of all fuels combined in any year before 2023.\n23\nThe rapid growth of solar is on display everywhere\nThe expansion of solar power is a worldwide phenomenon, with 99 countries doubling the \namount of electricity they produce from solar power in the last five years. The majority of \nsolar generation now comes from non-OECD countries (58%), with China alone making up \n39% of the global total. But even as some countries are already integrating high shares of \nsolar into their power systems, there is still room for rapid growth in other markets.\nSolar is growing all around the world\nAs solar’s share of the global electricity mix has risen to 6.9% of global generation in 2024, \nsome countries are showing it is possible to incorporate much larger amounts. There are \nnow 21 countries that generate more than 15% of their electricity from solar power, up from \njust three countries five years ago.\nIn 2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rising energy prices, EU Member \nStates strengthened their policies and targets for the clean electricity transition and \n24\naccelerated the rollout of cheap, fast-to-build sources of home-grown electricity, solar in \nparticular. Of the 15 countries with the highest solar shares in 2024, seven were in the \nEuropean Union. \nOutside Europe, Chile generated 22% of its electricity from solar power in 2024, up from just \n8% in 2019. Australia reached an 18% solar share in 2024, up from 7% in 2019.\nRapid growth is happening elsewhere too. In 2024, 81% of the rise in solar generation took \nplace in countries where it still made up less than a tenth of total output. For the first time \never, solar power was the largest single source of new electricity in China, rising by 250 TWh \n(+43%) to supply 8.3% of the country’s electricity. In Brazil, solar generation increased by 23 \nTWh (+45%) last year, following a 71% increase in 2023. Solar now provides 10% of Brazil’s \nelectricity in 2024, up from just 1% five years ago.\nOver the last five years, 99 countries have doubled the amount of electricity they produce \nfrom solar power. This includes emerging economies such as South Africa, countries with the \nlargest power systems in the world such as China and the United States and countries with \nthe highest shares of solar power in their electricity mix such as Hungary and Spain.\nGrowth in China means that more than half of solar generation is now outside of the OECD\nIn 2024, non-OECD economies accounted for 58% of global solar generation, with 39% in \nChina alone. This marks a significant change from a decade ago, in 2014, when OECD \ncountries made up 81% of global solar generation.\nAs this growth continues to spread, new solar superpowers are emerging. In 2022, India \novertook Japan to become the third-largest solar generator in the world. In 2024, Brazil \novertook Germany to become the fifth-largest. Alongside China, this means that BRICS \nmembers now represent three of the world’s top five solar generating countries.\nThis trend shows no signs of slowing, with solar generation in China growing by 250 TWh in \n2024, compared to the 142 TWh increase seen in OECD countries. Solar capacity installations \nin China were 30% higher than in 2023, while in India, 2024 installations doubled from the \nprevious year (see Chapter 2.3).\n26\nExports data reveals solar growth is taking off in new markets\nSolar is now so cheap that large markets can emerge in the space of a single year - as \nevidenced in Pakistan in 2024. Amid high electricity prices linked to expensive contracts with \nprivately-owned thermal power stations, rooftop solar installations in Pakistan’s homes and \nbusinesses soared as a means of accessing lower cost power. The country imported 17 GW \nof solar panels in 2024 to meet this growing consumer demand, double the amount \nimported the year before. Within just a year, Pakistan became one of the world’s largest \nmarkets for new solar installations in 2024. Pakistan’s case shows that the low-cost, fast-to-\nbuild nature of solar power can transform electricity systems at an unprecedented rate. \nUpdated system planning and regulatory frameworks are needed alongside this \ndeployment to ensure a sustainable and managed transition.\nThere are signs in other regions that more rapid change could be around the corner. \nBecause Chinese factories account for more than 80% of global solar manufacturing \ncapacity, data on exports from China can act as a proxy for demand in countries without a \ndomestic solar manufacturing industry. Data for 2024 reveals a considerable rise in solar \nexports to the Middle East and Africa - two of the world’s sunniest regions that have \nhistorically had very low levels of installed capacity. In both regions, imports of solar panels \nhave tripled in the last two years.\n27\nSouth Africa imported 3.8 GW of solar panels in 2024, following a record-breaking 2023 when \n4.3 GW were imported as consumers turned to the technology amid rising blackouts. Nigeria \nand Morocco imported 1.3 GW and 1.1 GW respectively, marking the first time that either \ncountry has imported more than 1 GW in a single year.\nIn the Middle East, Saudi Arabia imported 16 GW in 2024, more than double the amount \nimported the year before. Oman saw the largest percentage growth in imports in the region, \nwith 2.5 GW of imports in 2024 representing a fivefold increase from the year before.\nFlexibility can enable further growth in solar power generation\nSolar power’s role in the mix varies greatly throughout the day in markets with high solar \nshares. During the sunniest parts of the day, solar quickly becomes the main source of \nelectricity in countries such as Chile and the Netherlands before dropping away again as the \nsun goes down. This variability can mean that low cost electricity goes unused during peak \nsolar hours, and the impact of this on wholesale prices can affect the economics of projects \nfor developers. Falling battery prices now mean there is an opportunity to better integrate far \nhigher levels of solar and other variable sources of power.\nFalling prices make battery storage a winning solution\nBattery storage technology, much like solar panels, has undergone rapid cost reductions in \nthe last decade. The average price of lithium ion battery packs dropped to $115 USD/kWh in \n2024, a 20% cost reduction from the year before and 84% lower than the average cost a \ndecade ago. As the price has fallen, annual installations of battery storage capacity have \nincreased dramatically at an average rate of 67% per year over the last decade. 69 GW of \nbattery storage capacity was installed in 2024 - almost enough to double total battery \nstorage capacity, which stood at 86 GW in 2023.\nThe 20% fall in battery pack costs in 2024 marks the largest percentage reduction in cost in a \nsingle year since 2017, and the largest absolute reduction since 2019. These cost reductions \nhave been driven by economies of scale as manufacturing capacity has stepped up, and by \nincreased adoption of lower-cost battery chemistries such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP), \nwhich eliminates the need for nickel and cobalt. Material costs have also come down after a \nbrief surge in lithium prices in 2022.\n28\nSolar and batteries combined are a powerful combination\nThe low cost of lithium ion batteries makes them an ideal choice for storing the excess \nelectricity produced by solar power during the sunniest hours until it is most needed. \nAlongside other storage technologies, demand-shifting and enhanced interconnection \nbetween countries, they can enable larger amounts of solar power to be successfully \nintegrated into power systems.\nIn Europe, co-locating battery storage systems with solar plants improves the business case\nfor solar. A recent study found that in Germany, the cost of building and operating utility-\nscale solar with integrated battery storage has now become cheaper than the equivalent \ncost for gas-fired power plants.\nIn the United States, California is at the forefront of using battery storage to complement \nlarge amounts of solar power. In 2024, batteries routinely met close to a fifth of daily peak \nload in the evening hours, displacing gas generation. This has been a rapid change: the \naverage share of evening peak load met by batteries nearly doubled from 2023 to 2024, \nwhile just three years ago, California’s battery fleet met less than 2% of evening peak load.\n29\nBatteries have now become so cost-competitive that they have opened up the possibility of \nround-the-clock solar power becoming a reality. In early 2025, the world’s first 24-hour solar \nPV project was announced - 1 GW of baseload electricity capacity in Abu Dhabi. The state-\nowned renewable energy company Masdar provided a $6 billion investment to build 5 GW of \nsolar and 19 GWh of battery capacity, planned to come online in 2027.\nThe potential for round-the-clock solar will be transformative, outcompeting fossil fuels both \non costs and security of supply. The rapid growth of solar and batteries is already \ntransforming electricity systems around the world, but there will be an even more profound \nshift in the coming years as energy storage technologies reach scale.\n30\nEmerging drivers of demand like EVs, heat pumps and data centres \nhave structurally raised demand growth. Though long-term demand \nforecasts have been revised upwards, there remain uncertainties about \nthe scale of growth that will materialise in the coming years. Clean \ngeneration is still expected to expand quickly enough to exceed higher \nlevels of demand growth, but achieving significant reductions in fossil \nfuel generation will now require higher levels of clean deployment.\nDemand growth is higher than it used to be\n2023 and 2024 saw the same rate of electricity demand growth of 3.3%, once adjusted for \ndifferences in temperatures (see chapter 1). This is higher than the 2.5% average growth seen \nover the previous decade, and in part reflects the emergence of new drivers of electricity \ndemand such as EVs, heat pumps and data centres. Combined, these three technologies \nincreased electricity demand by 0.7% in 2024. This is more than double the rate of demand \nincrease they contributed five years ago, when they were responsible for increasing global \nelectricity demand by 0.3% per year.\nEmerging drivers cause higher rates of electricity demand growth\nEmerging drivers of electricity demand such as EVs, data centres and heat pumps have \nshown similar rates of growth over the last two years. These three technologies are \nestimated to have added 0.7% to global demand in 2024 (+195 TWh), a slight step up from \nthe 0.6% they added in 2023 (+174 TWh).\n31\n2.2 Clean generation is  \n \n \n \n \n \nexpected to meet higher   \n \n \nlevels of demand growth\nElectrification is a major driver, as systems that once ran on fossil fuels switch to electricity, \nincreasing electricity demand but reducing overall energy demand through efficiency gains. \nEV electricity demand grew by an impressive 38% in 2024 (+62 TWh), increasing from 163 \nTWh in 2023 to 225 TWh in 2024 and adding 0.2% to global electricity demand. This increase \nwas five times larger than the growth in EV electricity demand seen in 2019. Heat pumps are \nestimated to have added an additional 22 TWh electricity demand in 2024, which was lower \nthan the 25 TWh seen in 2023, as sales in key markets slowed slightly. \nDemand from data centres and cryptocurrency mining is estimated to have increased by \n20% (+111 TWh) in 2024, slightly higher than the increase seen in 2023. This added 0.4% to \nglobal electricity demand in both years. Crypto mining is estimated to have driven 40% of \nthe overall 111 TWh increase in 2024.\nThese emerging drivers mean that electricity demand growth is structurally higher than it \nwas over the previous decade, when it averaged 2.5% per year. \n32\nExpectations rise for future demand growth, but remain uncertain\nLooking to the future, forecasts for electricity demand growth have been revised upwards. If \nhigh short-term forecasts become reality, it would represent a big step up in structural \ndemand growth compared with 2024. The size of temporary factors driving demand growth \nin 2024 raise questions about whether this high growth will be maintained in 2025. In the \nlonger term, the scale of future growth of emerging drivers of demand remains uncertain.\nExpectations for future electricity demand growth are now much higher than they used to \nbe\nThe International Energy Agency’s (IEA) current outlooks for future electricity demand \nenvisage higher levels of demand growth than was previously expected. The IEA’s STEPS \nscenario released in October 2024 forecasts annual demand growth of 3.3% between 2023 \nand 2030, higher than the 2.7% growth they forecast in 2023 between 2022 and 2030. The \nupgrade to 3.3% annual growth equates to an additional 1,687 TWh of annual electricity \ndemand by 2030, with the IEA citing increased expectations for demand from data centres \nas well as increased power usage for cooling, alongside electric mobility and light industrial \nconsumption.\nMore recent analyses point to even faster growth. In February 2025, the IEA published a \nshort-term forecast for the years 2025-2027, in which total generation is expected to \nincrease by an average of 3.7% annually.\nFactors driving demand growth in 2024 raise questions about whether this high growth \nwill be maintained in 2025\nThere are reasons to question whether the levels of demand growth forecast by the IEA for \nthe next three years will materialise. If they do, this would represent a significant increase in \nstructural demand growth. Two key factors – the impact of heatwaves globally and a \nrebound in industrial demand in China in January 2024 – added considerably to demand \ngrowth last year but will not contribute this same amount year after year. Combined, these \nfactors were responsible for almost a quarter of the demand growth seen in 2024; without \nthem, demand growth would have been 0.9% lower.\nTemperature effects were the most significant temporary factor, adding 0.7% to demand \ngrowth in 2024 because of much higher temperatures around population centres compared \nwith the year before (see Chapter 1). If 2025 sees the same intensity of heatwaves as in 2024, \n33\nthis would result in no year-on-year impact on demand growth caused by temperatures. If \nother demand growth were to remain stable year-on-year, then 2025 would see electricity \ndemand growth of 3.3% instead of the 4.0% seen in 2024. If summer temperatures in 2025 are \ncooler than in 2024, then demand growth would be even more modest.\nSecondly, China’s industrial demand growth is unlikely to be as high in 2025 as it was in 2024, \nwhen it was still being influenced by the economic recovery from Covid-19. January 2024 \nsaw a significant rebound (+58 TWh) in industrial electricity demand in China compared to \nthe reduced level seen in January 2023, which was affected by Covid-19. The increase in \nChinese industrial demand in January 2024 alone contributed 0.2% to global demand \ngrowth in 2024. The high rate of growth seen in the first month of the year was not sustained \nthroughout the rest of 2024.\nWithout these additional factors driving demand growth beyond 2024, the IEA’s forecast of \n3.7% annual growth in total power generation over the next three years would represent a \nsignificant step up in structural growth. It remains to be seen if such high levels materialise. \n34\nLarge uncertainties remain across many sectors\nElectricity demand growth forecasts are being revised upwards amid intense speculation \nabout the impact of new major consumers such as data centres.\nRising demand for electricity to train models for artificial intelligence has increased data \ncentre power consumption in recent years, following a period of stable demand in the \nsector. Looking forward, recent projections from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \n(LBNL) suggest that electricity consumption by US data centres could triple from 176 TWh in \n2023 to reach 580 TWh in 2028 – which would then account for 12% of US electricity demand. \nHowever, the LBNL’s lower-end estimate places demand from data centres at 325 TWh, just \nover half the high-case estimate. The uncertainty in these forecasts by 2028 is equivalent to \nAustralia’s annual electricity consumption.\n35\nClean electricity is growing quickly enough to meet higher levels of \ndemand growth\nClean generation is still expected to exceed growth in electricity demand\nForecasts for wind and solar capacity additions from the Global Wind Energy Council \n(GWEC) and Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) predict strong growth in both \ntechnologies. BNEF predicts solar capacity additions to reach close to 1 TW per year by 2030, \nup from the 585 GW seen in 2024. Meanwhile, GWEC expects annual wind capacity additions \nto reach 182 GW by 2028.\nAssuming typical capacity factors, we estimate that these new additions would result in \nsolar generation growth of 21% on average per year between 2024 and 2030, and wind \ngeneration growth of 13% per year. Combined with modest growth in hydro and nuclear \npower, clean generation is expected to grow at an average rate of 9% per year between now \nand 2030, adding a combined 8,399 TWh of annual generation by 2030.\nThe expected growth in clean sources would be sufficient to keep pace with a demand \nincrease of 4.1% per year to 2030, which exceeds the 3.3% demand growth expected in the \nIEA’s STEPS scenario as well as their short-term forecast of 3.7% growth over the next three \nyears.\n36\nThe expectations for demand and clean growth mean that fossil generation is set for \nstructural decline over the rest of the decade, by a small margin in the near-term and a \nconfident margin by the end of the decade.\nSeparating the signal from the noise for future fossil generation\nClean generation growth is expected to exceed demand growth over the rest of the decade, \nbut in the short-term the higher expectations for demand growth means the gap with clean \ngeneration growth has narrowed. Over the next few years, the size of changes in fossil \ngeneration will be small but noisy, and partially determined by fluctuations in weather \nconditions from one year to the next. \nAs an example, temperature effects increased demand growth by 208 TWh in 2024, but \nreduced demand growth by 186 TWh in 2023. Weather conditions can also impact the supply \nof clean generation: wind and hydro conditions in 2024 were both below the long-term \naverage. If global weather conditions in 2024 had been in line with the five-year average, \nwind generation would have been 3.7% higher (+92 TWh) and hydro generation would have \nbeen 2% higher (+86 TWh). How these factors interact in the coming years will significantly \ndetermine the scale of fossil generation declines.\nAlthough the world is close to a new era of structurally falling fossil power, in the short-term \nthere are likely to be year-on-year fluctuations with small increases or decreases in fossil \ngeneration depending on weather conditions and other temporary factors. In the long-term, \ndespite higher demand growth projections, clean growth will be sufficient to maintain \nconsistent declines in fossil generation. However, based on current industry forecasts these \ndeclines will initially be small. Unlocking rapid declines in fossil generation will require faster \ndeployment of clean generation, alongside the expansion of grids and flexibility \nmechanisms such as storage.\n37\nChina and India are breaking the long-standing link between electricity \ndemand growth and fossil fuel expansion in the power sector. In 2024, \nChina’s clean electricity additions met 81% of demand growth, driven by \nrecord installations of wind and solar capacity. India’s solar capacity \nadditions in 2024 doubled compared to 2023. The two largest emerging \neconomies are on a path of clean electricity expansion that is set to \nreverse their power sector fossil growth trends, tipping the global \nbalance on fossil generation.\nChina and India are decoupling electricity demand growth from fossil \ngrowth\nChina’s and India’s economic development has been accompanied by large increases in \nelectricity demand. India’s electricity demand has tripled in the last two decades, while \nChina’s has quadrupled. Fast paced clean electricity deployment is now breaking a long-\nterm trend, as fossil generation is no longer growing at the same rate as electricity demand. \nThis decoupling is happening because a growing share of demand growth is being met by \nan expansion of clean sources rather than fossil generation.\n38\n2.3 Future electricity demand   \n \n \ngrowth in India and China   \n \n \nwill be powered by clean   \n \n \nsources \nIn China, this process started in the early 2010s, with rising wind, hydro and nuclear power \nmeeting increasing shares of demand growth. In recent years, solar has surged to the point \nwhere clean sources are now growing at a rate fast enough to meet all demand growth – \nbar yearly fluctuations in weather affecting demand and hydro output – and are on track to \nstart replacing fossil generation.\nIndia’s decoupling of demand growth and fossil growth began more recently. In 2024, India \nstill met about two-thirds of its demand growth with fossil fuels, specifically coal power. With \nincreasing deployment of clean capacity, India could meet all new demand growth with \nclean electricity as soon as 2030, according to the IEA’s STEPS scenario. This would lead to a \nplateauing of fossil generation in the country. Ember’s modelling of India’s power sector to \n2032 shows that limiting the growth of fossil fuels through a build-out of renewables, \nparticularly solar power, brings cost benefits.\n39\nThe end is in sight for China’s fossil-based demand growth\nChina’s staggering growth in electricity demand over the last two decades was \naccompanied by a rapid rise in fossil generation. Wind, solar, hydro and nuclear \ndeployments have now reached levels sufficient to meet China’s structural (non-\ntemperature related) annual rise in power demand. As a result, a substantial expansion of \nfossil generation is increasingly unlikely.\nClean electricity deployment in China takes the next step\nIn the last two years, China has seen a surge in clean electricity, primarily driven by large-\nscale wind and solar rollouts. Solar capacity jumped by 217 gigawatt of AC capacity (GWac) \nin 2023—more than double the 86 GWac added the previous year (many countries report \nsolar capacity data in AC instead of DC. DC capacity is used in this report if not otherwise \nspecified). In 2024, capacity installations increased further to reach 277 GWac. This \nconstitutes more than a tripling of the installation rate in just two years. Wind capacity saw \nthe highest-ever additions in 2024, with 79 GW installed after a record-setting 2023 (76 GW).\n40\nWith this rapid increase in 2023 and 2024, China more than doubled its total installed solar \ncapacity in just two years, rising from 393 GWac in 2022 to 887 GWac in 2024. China led the \nworld in 2024 as it made up an estimated 57% of global solar capacity additions and 60% of \nglobal wind capacity additions. The step-up in capacity deployment in the last two years will \nnot be an outlier. BloombergNEF expects China’s solar capacity deployment in 2025 to \nincrease by a further 12% compared to 2024. As of 2024, China had nearly twice the amount \nof wind and solar capacity under construction as the rest of the world combined, pointing to \ncontinued fast growth in the coming years.\nAdditionally, China boasts the largest pipeline for large-scale hydroelectric power stations \nand nuclear plants, and has seen the largest increases from these sources of any country in \nrecent years. \nCombined, the scale of clean power deployment in China has reached a level where it can \nmeet the structural growth in China’s electricity demand.\nChina’s record clean power additions put falling fossil power generation in sight\nGrowth in clean electricity generation met 81% of China’s increase in electricity demand in \n2024, the highest share since 2015 when demand fell. The 6.6% (+623 TWh) rise in electricity \ndemand was largely met by a rise in wind and solar generation (+356 TWh), and a rebound \nin hydro generation (+130 TWh). Consequently, fossil generation only increased by 116 TWh, a \nthird of the increase seen in 2023.\nHowever, hotter temperatures in 2024 compared to 2023 resulted in an elevated demand \nrise. The impact was particularly large during the heatwaves the country experienced in the \nsummer of 2024. Without the effects of hotter temperatures, clean generation would have \nbeen enough to meet 97% of China’s rise in electricity demand.\nAdditionally, January and February saw the last effects of the rebound in industrial electricity \ndemand after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in early 2023. This temporary boost \ncontributed to a 10.9% increase in overall electricity demand over January and February \n2023, amounting to nearly a quarter (24%) of China’s total demand growth in 2024. For the \nrest of the year, demand grew at a much more moderate rate of 6.1%.\n42\nShort-term uncertainties, but long-term outlook points to falling fossil generation in \nChina\nChina is close to meeting all demand growth with clean sources, which will mark a turning \npoint where fossil fuels reach their peak and begin to decline. In the short term, uncertainties \nremain on both the demand and supply sides. \nOn the demand side, temperature fluctuations drive temporary changes from year to year. \nOn the supply side, China’s hydro output rebounded by 130 TWh in 2024 after drought-\ninduced lows in 2023. Yet capacity factors were still below historical levels, and further \nrecovery in 2025 remains uncertain. While wind and solar outputs are generally more stable, \nthe large installed capacity means that even small changes in wind conditions across years \ncan significantly affect generation. In 2024, poorer wind conditions in China masked \nunderlying growth from new capacity. Solar output varies less from year to year, but can still \naffect output notably.\nThese short-term factors can obscure underlying trends, making year-on-year predictions \nchallenging. However, with rapid expansion in solar and wind capacity, further increases in \nfossil generation are becoming less likely. In fact, 2025 may mark the first decline in fossil \ngeneration since 2015 – even as electricity demand continues to rise – signaling an end to \nthe era of sustained large-scale fossil generation growth in China.\nIndia’s fossil surge could already be slowing\nWith China close to entering a new era of falling fossil generation, India is likely to become \nthe country with the largest fossil generation growth in coming years, surpassing China. Just \nlike in 2023, India recorded the second-largest increase in fossil generation of any country, at \n67 TWh in 2024. However, India and similar emerging economies now have cleaner \nalternatives to fossil-led growth, limiting a potential surge in fossil generation.\nIndia’s clean power deployment is ramping up\nThe economics for new power have shifted heavily in favour of renewables. The cost of solar \npower fell by more than 90% between 2010 and 2023. Consequently, deployment is rising \nsharply worldwide, and India is no exception. India’s solar power capacity increased by 24 \nGWac in 2024 – more than twice as much as in 2023. Only China and the US installed more \n43\nsolar capacity in 2024. Installations are only expected to increase further. Utility-scale \nprojects already under construction as of January 2025 will nearly double India’s wind and \nsolar capacity.\nThere are currently 143 GW of wind and solar capacity under construction in India, consisting \nof 82 GW of solar, 25 GW of wind and 36 GW of hybrid capacity (wind and solar), according \nto government reporting. These projects all have an expected completion date before the \nend of 2028.\nIndia’s government has set a broader target of 500 GW for clean power capacity by 2030, up \nfrom 211 GW in 2024. Additionally, there are 5 GW of nuclear capacity and 15 GW of hydro \ncapacity currently under construction, with commissioning expected before the end of 2028. \nAs explored in chapter 2.2, storage is a critical element of the continued build-out of flexible, \ncost-effective clean power, and India is no exception. To further accelerate the deployment \n44\nand integration of solar power in India, the Indian government has advised implementing \nagencies and state utilities to include energy storage systems with a minimum of two hours \nof storage alongside solar facilities.\nClean electricity is reducing the need for additional fossil power\nIndia’s rapid clean capacity growth will significantly reduce the increase in fossil generation \nover the next few years. In the six years between 2019 and 2024, electricity demand \nincreased by 478 TWh, with clean generation meeting 33% of this increase. The IEA’s STEPS \nScenario projects a further 844 TWh rise in electricity demand by 2030. Despite this larger \nincrease, the rapid deployment of clean power, predominantly from solar and wind, could \nmeet an estimated 75% of this demand growth.\n45\nClean growth in China and India can tip the balance towards a decline \nin fossil generation at a global level\nBending the curve of fossil generation at a global level depends on country level trends. The \nfirst major emitters to industrialise – the EU, the US and other OECD economies – have seen \nfossil generation peak in the early 20th century and have contributed to a reduction of fossil \nuse in the power sector for more than 15 years. \nSimultaneously, fast growing Asian economies, especially China and India, have seen a \nrapid increase in electricity demand and fossil consumption for electricity. As a result, they \nhave dominated the global increase in fossil generation over the past two decades. \nIn the last five years, global annual fossil generation has increased by 1,165 TWh. China alone \naccounted for 1,104 TWh of this increase, which was equivalent to 95% of the net global \nincrease between 2020 and 2024. India contributed a further 322 TWh, or 28% of the net \nglobal increase. Other countries combined saw a net reduction of 260 TWh in fossil \ngeneration.\n46\nIn the next five years, it is the trend reversal in China and India that will tip the balance \ntowards a global decline in fossil generation. Using the IEA’s STEPS Scenario, India’s fossil \ngeneration is expected to grow by an estimated 197 TWh by 2029. This is consistent with \nestimates from India’s existing renewable capacity pipeline. This increase would be just \nunder half of the increase over the previous five years.\nThe largest reversal according to the STEPS scenario would come from China, turning an \nincrease of 1,104 TWh in the previous five years into a fall of 501 TWh for 2025-2029. As \ndiscussed earlier, this shift is driven by the rapid expansion of clean electricity, which has \ndecoupled demand growth from fossil generation. Combined with larger falls in the rest of \nthe world of 849 TWh, global fossil generation in 2029 would be 1,153 TWh (6.3%) lower than in \n2024.\nWith China and India turning towards clean growth, established clean energy players \nneed to double down\nOverall, 115 countries making up 39% of global electricity demand have seen their fossil \ngeneration remain the same or decline over the last five years. If China and India join this \ngroup, it would raise the share of global electricity demand in economies with falling fossil \ngeneration to 79%, thereby tipping the balance on global fossil generation and power sector \nemissions.\nConsolidating the fall in global fossil generation not only requires the rapid scale-up of clean \npower in China and India, but also the continued reduction of fossil generation in the United \nStates, the EU and other advanced economies. Recent US policy announcements, signalling \na trend reversal away from clean power back towards a growth model relying on more fossil \nfuels, risk slowing the decline of US fossil generation, which peaked in 2007. \nThe overall trend in the global power sector shows that the next few years will be marked by \na rapid and increasing build-out of renewables, with solar power at the forefront. Countries \nthat focus on adapting appropriate policies to take advantage of integrating these low-cost \nand fast-to-deploy technologies will reap the benefits of the clean energy transition. Those \nwho choose to turn their backs risk being left behind.\n47\nChapter 3: Global Electricity Trends\nData on the global electricity sector in 2024, including generation, \ndemand and emissions, with an overview of changes in the last year \nand trends in the last two decades.\nChapter contents\n3.1 Global electricity demand \n49\n3.2 Global electricity generation \n53\n3.3 Global power sector emissions \n57\nData on the global \nelectricity sector in 2024\n48\nElectricity demand saw the third-largest absolute increase \never in 2024\n01\nChina’s per capita electricity use overtook France’s for the first \ntime in 2024, and was five times that of India’s\n02\nA fifth of the demand increase in 2024 was due to the impacts \nof hotter temperatures compared to 2023\n03\nKey highlights\n49\n3.1 Global electricity   \n \n \n \ndemand\nGlobal electricity demand \nincreased by 4% (+1,172 TWh) in \n2024. This was the third-\nlargest absolute increase in \nelectricity demand ever, only \nsurpassed by rebounds in \ndemand in 2010 from the \nglobal recession and in 2021 \nfrom the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThis increase is significantly \nabove the average annual \ndemand growth of 2.5% in the \nprevious ten years (2014-\n2023).\nGlobal electricity demand rose to 30,856 TWh, crossing 30,000 TWh for the first time. Since the turn of \nthe century, electricity demand has doubled.\nSome of the exceptional growth in 2024 was due to weather conditions. As explored in chapter 1, we \ncalculate that hotter temperatures added 0.7% to global demand in 2024. Nonetheless, emerging \ndrivers of electricity demand such as electric vehicles (EVs), data centres and heat pumps also \nadded 0.7% to global demand growth in 2024 (+195 TWh), a slight step up from the 0.6% they added in \n2023 (+174 TWh). See more in chapter 2.2.\nChina recorded the largest increase in electricity demand, adding 623 TWh (+6.6%), which accounted \nfor more than half of the global increase. The US saw a rise of 128 TWh (+3%). India’s demand \nincreased by 98 TWh (+5%). As recent Ember analysis shows, all three countries experienced \nheatwaves that drove up electricity demand beyond increases due to economic activity.\nOther countries with substantial increases were Brazil (+35 TWh, +4.9%), Russia (+32 TWh, +2.8%), Viet \nNam (+26 TWh, +9.5%) and Türkiye (+18 TWh, +5.6%).\n50\nChina’s share of global \nelectricity demand has \nincreased due to its continued \ndemand growth above the \nworld average. With 10,066 \nTWh, China’s electricity \ndemand contributed roughly a \nthird (32.6%) of the global total, \nup from 28% five years ago. \nChina’s global share of \ndemand was more than \ndouble that of the US at 4,401 \nTWh (14.3% of the global total). \nThe EU made up 8.8% (2,727 TWh) of global electricity demand. India’s electricity demand reached \n2,054 TWh (6.7% of global demand). \n26% of global electricity demand comes from economies that each contribute less than 2%.\nAmong the top ten electricity \nconsumers, the difference in per \ncapita consumption remained \nvast. Canada had the highest per \ncapita demand for electricity at \n15.5 megawatt hours (MWh). This \nwas more than 10 times higher \nthan India, which places last \namong this group at 1.4 MWh. \nChina’s per capita demand (7.1 \nMWh) was almost double the \nworld average of 3.8 MWh, \novertaking France in 2024 and \nGermany in 2023. \n51\nAsia’s electricity demand has \ngrown fourfold since the turn of \nthe century from 4,199 TWh in \n2000 to 16,153 TWh in 2024 \n(+285%), driven by demand \nincreases in China, and \nincreasingly India, Indonesia, Viet \nNam and other fast-growing \neconomies. \nThis trend was not replicated \nelsewhere. Demand outside Asia \ngrew by just 3,624 TWh (+33%) \nover the same period, from 11,079 \nTWh to 14,703 TWh.\nDespite moderate increases in the past decade, the entire continent of Africa accounted for just 3.1% \nof total global electricity demand in 2024, less than Japan.\n52\nLow-carbon sources surpassed 40% of global electricity \ngeneration, driven by record renewables growth\n01\nGlobal solar generation has doubled in three years, continuing \nits pattern of exponential growth\n02\nWind and solar have met more than half of global growth in \nelectricity demand since 2015\n03\nKey highlights\n53\n3.2 Global electricity   \n \n \n \ngeneration\nIn 2024, low-carbon power \nsources rose to 40.9% of global \nelectricity generation, the \nhighest level since the 1940s \nwhen hydro generation alone \nmet over 40%.\nSolar and wind power are the \nfastest-growing sources of \nelectricity. Combined, they \naccounted for 15% of global \nelectricity in 2024, with solar \ncontributing 6.9% and wind \n8.1%. The two sources \ncombined now produce more electricity than hydropower at 14.3%. They already surpassed nuclear \ngeneration in 2021, which continues to reduce in share (9% in 2024). The rise in wind and solar power \nover recent years has been remarkable, with solar in particular maintaining rapid growth rates \ndespite reaching high levels of absolute generation. Solar power has doubled in the three years since \n2021, continuing its pattern of exponential growth.\nThe share of fossil sources declined to 59.1% in 2024, despite increases in absolute generation. It has \ndeclined substantially since the peak of 68.3% in 2007 and is set to fall further in the coming years as \nrenewable generation growth continues to accelerate. The share of coal generation has fallen \nsignificantly, from 40.8% in 2007 to 34.4% in 2024, with more consistent falls in the last 10 years. The \nshare of gas generation has fallen for four consecutive years since it peaked in 2020 at 23.9%, \nreaching 22% in 2024.\nClean generation met 79% of the increase in global electricity demand in 2024. Electricity generation \nfrom clean sources grew by 927 TWh (+7.9%), the largest increase ever recorded. The clean \ngeneration increase in 2024 would have been large enough to meet the rise in electricity demand in \nall but three years in the last two decades. \nHowever, heatwaves in 2024 elevated cooling demand, which was the main driver of a small 1.4% \nincrease in fossil generation (+245 TWh), similar to the rise in the previous two years. Without the \nimpact of hotter temperatures, fossil generation would have remained flat.\n54\nRenewables growth alone met \n73% of the increase in \nelectricity demand. In total, \nrenewable power sources \nadded a record 858 TWh of \ngeneration in 2024, 49% more \nthan the previous record set in \n2022 of 577 TWh.\nSolar dominated the growth in \nelectricity generation as it was \nthe largest source of new \nelectricity for the third year in a \nrow. Solar added 474 TWh \n(+29%) in 2024. Solar’s increase alone met 40% of global electricity demand growth in 2024. Wind \ngrowth remained more moderate (+182 TWh, +7.9%), with lower wind speeds in some geographies \nleading to the lowest increase in wind generation in four years despite continued capacity additions. \nHydro generation rebounded in 2024 (+182 TWh) as drought conditions in 2023 eased, particularly in \nChina.\nNuclear generation increased by 69 TWh (+2.5%), mostly as a result of less downtime for reactors in \nFrance as well as small increases from new reactors in China.\nThe global increase in fossil generation came mostly from coal which rose by 149 TWh (+1.4%). Gas \ngeneration increased by 103 TWh (+1.6%). Other fossil fuels saw a minor fall of 7.7 TWh (-0.9%).\nChina and India saw the largest increases in coal generation in 2024, together totalling more than the \nglobal net increase. The gas generation growth in the US alone (+59 TWh, +3.3%) was equivalent to \n57% of the global increase. Gas generation in the US is rising mainly as a result of coal-to-gas \nswitching. Ember’s analysis shows that heatwaves also played a role in raising fossil generation in \nChina, India and the US in 2024.\n55\nSince 2015, solar and wind have \nbeen the two largest-growing \nsources of electricity, meeting \nmore than half (52%) of global \ndemand growth. Solar generation \nhas grown eightfold since 2015, \nfrom 256 TWh in 2015 to 2,131 TWh \nin 2024. Wind generation tripled \nfrom 830 TWh in 2015 to 2,494 \nTWh in 2024.\nChina has dominated changes in \nthe global electricity system since \n2015, recording the largest \nincreases of any country for solar, wind, hydro, nuclear and coal. China accounts for 45% of global \ngrowth in wind and solar generation since 2015. At the same time, global coal generation would have \nfallen since 2015 without the increase in China.\nIndia saw the second-largest increase in coal generation behind China. India’s rise in coal generation \nwas equivalent to 40% of the global increase in coal since 2015.\nThe US was responsible for 43% of the global increase in gas generation since 2015. Its gas generation \nincreased by 40% (+531 TWh) over the same period.\n56\nPower sector emissions hit a new record high as heatwaves \ndrove a small rise in fossil generation\n01\nCarbon intensity fell by 15% since its peak in 2007, driven by \nclean generation growing faster than fossil generation\n02\nAfrica and Latin America each make up less than 4% of global \npower sector emissions, despite representing 19% and 8% of \nthe global population respectively\n03\nKey highlights\n57\n3.3 Global power sector  \n \n \nemissions\nGlobal power sector emissions \nreached a new record high in \n2024, rising by 1.6% or 223 \nmillion tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), \ncompared to 2023. This \nincrease was similar to 2023 \n(+1.5%) and 2022 (+1.3%) and \nwas driven by an increase in \nfossil generation, \npredominantly from coal. \nHowever, without the impact of \n2024’s heatwaves, fossil \ngeneration would only have \nrisen by 0.2% from 2023, and \npower sector emissions would have remained almost unchanged (see Chapter 1). \nDespite the overall increase in power sector emissions, the emissions intensity (emissions per unit of \nelectricity produced) of global power generation continued to decrease. Emissions intensity dropped \nby 2.3% to 473 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour (gCO2/kWh), down from 484 gCO2/kWh in 2023. \nEmissions intensity has now fallen in nine of the last ten years, with the only increase occurring in 2021 \nas fossil generation rebounded following large falls in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe decline in emissions intensity is driven by the growing share of clean power in the mix, which \nreached 40.9% in 2024. As of 2024, the emissions intensity of the global power sector has fallen by 15% \nsince the peak of 555 gCO2/kWh in 2007.\nChina’s size and reliance on coal generation kept it as the world’s highest power sector emitter in \n2024, with emissions reaching 5,640 MtCO2, four times those of the US and India. \nEmissions from power generation in the US amounted to 1,683 MtCO2, accounting for 11.5% of the \nglobal total. India’s power sector emissions reached 1,457 MtCO2, now close to matching the US and \nreaching 10% of global power sector emissions for the first time.\n58\nChina accounted for 38.6% of \nglobal power sector emissions \n- more than the US, India, the \nEU, Russia and Japan \ncombined. Countries \nindividually producing less \nthan 2% of global power sector \nemissions made up the \nremaining 28.8% of the global \ntotal.\nIndia and China had the highest \nemissions intensity of electricity \nproduction among the top ten \nelectricity consumers. India’s \nemissions intensity remained \nparticularly high at 708 gCO2/\nkWh, compared to the global \naverage of 473 gCO2/kWh. \nHowever, India’s emissions \nintensity has been falling as clean \ngeneration has been growing \nfaster than coal.\nCanada, Brazil and France had \nthe lowest emissions intensity due to their high shares of low-carbon generation from hydro and \nnuclear, along with a growing share of wind and solar.\nDespite this, Canada’s emissions per capita (2.8 tCO2) were nearly three times larger than India’s (1 \ntCO2), driven by substantially higher per capita demand for electricity.\n59\nSouth Korea (5 tCO2) and the US (4.9 tCO2) had the highest power sector emissions per capita \namong the ten biggest electricity consumers due to a combination of high per capita electricity \ndemand and a high share of fossil generation in the mix. China’s emissions per capita have risen to \nmatch Japan’s at 4 tCO2.\nDriven by rapidly growing \nelectricity demand in Asian \neconomies, Asia’s share of global \npower sector emissions has \nsurged over the last two decades. \nIn 2000, Asia made up a third \n(33%) of global power sector \nemissions. In 2024, this had risen \nto nearly two-thirds (63%). \nPower sector emissions in North \nAmerica and Europe have both \nfallen by a third since peaking in \n2007. Within Europe, EU power \nsector emissions have halved (-52%) since 2007, whilst emissions in Russia and Türkiye have risen. In \nthe Middle East, emissions have risen more sharply, driven by growing electricity demand in large \nmarkets such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, where fossil fuels dominate the electricity mix. \nIn 2024, African countries still only made up 3.6% of global power sector emissions, despite accounting \nfor 19% of the world’s population. Similarly, Latin America and the Caribbean contributed just 3.2% of \nglobal power sector emissions while representing 8% of the global population.\n60\nChapter 4: Global Electricity Source Trends\nData on global electricity generation from solar, wind, hydro, nuclear \ncoal and gas in 2024, with an overview of changes in the last year and \ntrends in the last two decades.\nWe have ordered the sections according to the fastest growing sources (% growth) \nof electricity in 2024.\nChapter contents\n4.1 Solar \n63\n4.2 Wind \n66\n4.3 Hydro \n69\n4.4 Nuclear \n72\n4.5 Gas \n75\n4.6 Coal \n78\nAnalysis of the different \nelectricity sources in 2024\n61\n62\nSolar added twice as much generation as any other electricity \nsource in 2024 - 45% more than in 2023\n01\nChina added more solar generation than the rest of the world \ncombined in 2024\n02\nGlobal solar power continues to double every three years, \nmaintaining high growth rates even as it scales\n03\nKey highlights\n63\n4.1 Solar\n2024 represented another \nrecord year for solar power as \nit rose by 474 TWh to a new \nhigh of 2,131 TWh (+29%). The \nshare of solar in the global \nelectricity mix reached 6.9%, \nup from 5.6% in 2023.\nThe increase of 474 TWh was \n45% higher than in 2023 (+327 \nTWh). Solar added more than \ntwice as much electricity \ngeneration in 2024 as any \nother electricity source.\nSolar generation is now more than 20 times larger than it was in 2012, and its share of global \ngeneration over the same period has increased sixteenfold. \nGlobal solar power continues to double every three years, maintaining high growth rates even as it \nscales: 2024's growth rate of 29% was the fastest in six years. Solar generation took eight years to go \nfrom 100 TWh to 1,000 TWh, but it has only taken three years to double to over 2,000 TWh in 2024.\nChina continues to be the \ncountry with the largest rise in \nsolar generation, adding 250 \nTWh – more than half of the \nglobal change in generation \n(53%) in 2024 and four times \nmore than the second largest \nincrease in the United States \n(+64 TWh). This pushed up \nChina’s solar generation by an \nastonishing 43% compared to \n2023.\n64\nThe US, Brazil, India and Germany also saw record increases in generation, driven by record capacity \ninstallations in 2023 and 2024.\nBrazil has quickly become one of the world’s largest solar markets. Its 23 TWh (+45%) increase in solar \ngeneration in 2024 made it the country with the third-highest growth for the second year in a row.\nIn absolute terms, China is the \nglobal leader on solar. Its total \nsolar generation reached 834 \nTWh in 2024, greater than the \nglobal total just five years ago \nin 2019. 39% of the world’s solar \ngeneration came from China \nin 2024. \nJust eight years ago, Brazil \nranked 58th in the world for \nsolar generation. In 2024, it \novertook Germany to become \nthe fifth-largest solar \ngenerator, despite Germany also seeing a record increase.\n42 countries now generate at least a tenth of their electricity from solar. Of countries with more than 5 \nTWh of solar generation, Hungary became the country with the highest share of solar in the electricity \nmix at a quarter (25%), ahead of Chile (22%). Both countries' solar shares were less than 2% in 2015. \nAustralia remained the country with the highest solar generation per capita at 1,866 kWh,  over seven \ntimes the world average.\n65\nWind generation has tripled since 2015, reaching a new record \nhigh in 2024\n01\nWeather conditions meant wind generation growth was \nmodest in 2024, but it was still the second-fastest growing \nsource of new electricity\n02\n35 countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity \nfrom wind power in 2024\n03\nKey highlights\n66\n4.2 Wind\nGlobal wind generation \nreached a new record high of \n2,494 TWh in 2024, up 182 TWh \n(+7.9%) from 2023. Wind’s \nshare in the global electricity \nmix reached 8.1%, up from 7.8% \nin 2023.\nWind generation has tripled \nsince 2015, and its share in the \nglobal electricity mix has more \nthan doubled since then. \nDespite this positive overall \ntrend, growth in wind generation has slowed for the third year in a row. However, it was still the source \nwith the second-largest increase in 2024, behind solar. While capacity additions remained high, wind \ngeneration growth was limited by less windy conditions compared to 2023, particularly in China. \nWith wind capacity growth remaining strong across the world, generation is likely to return to higher \ngrowth in the coming years.\nChina accounted for well over \n50% of the global wind \nincrease in 2024, with its wind \ngeneration rising by 106 TWh \n(+12%). China’s wind \ngeneration increase in 2024 \nwas more than three times \nlarger than that of the US, \nwhich saw the second-biggest \nincrease in wind.\nChina has seen a large boom \nin wind power since 2020. In \nthe most recent data on \ncapacity additions from 2023, 66% of global onshore capacity additions and 64% of global offshore \ncapacity additions were in China.\n67\nWind generation in the US rebounded last year, increasing by 32 TWh, after a fall of 13 TWh in 2023. The \n2024 growth was a result of improved wind conditions, as well as new wind capacity.\nWind generation growth was more modest in Europe in 2024 than in 2023, with Germany and France \nseeing falls of 4 and 5 TWh respectively. Although capacity additions continued in 2024 in these \ncountries, less favourable wind conditions than in 2023 led to lower-than-expected generation. \nChina’s wind generation in \n2024 was 992 TWh, which was \nmore than the entire world’s \nwind generation eight years \nago. China currently accounts \nfor 40% of global wind \ngeneration.\nOverall, EU countries lead in \nshares of wind generation. Of \ncountries with more than 5 \nTWh of wind generation, \nDenmark was the global \nleader in 2024 at 58%. The top \nten also includes Ireland, Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, and Spain. Outside \nEurope, Morocco (22%) was a notable leader.\nAmong countries with the highest share, Finland doubled its share of wind generation since 2020, from \n12% to 24%. Morocco also saw a significant rise in wind generation in 2024 (+3.3 TWh, +50%) and now \nhas the ninth-largest share of wind power globally.\nOn a per capita basis, Nordic countries generated the most power from wind in 2024 with Sweden, \nFinland, Denmark and Norway remaining as the top four. Their per capita generation from wind was \nten times the world average.\n68\nHydro generation rebounded in 2024, mostly because of better \nweather conditions after widespread droughts in 2023\n01\nGlobal hydro generation reached a new record high in 2024, \nhowever its utilisation rates were still below the ten-year \naverage\n02\nChina accounted for 71% of the global rise in hydro generation \nin 2024\n03\nKey highlights\n69\n4.3 Hydro\nHydro power rebounded in \n2024 after droughts in key \ncountries in 2023, with global \ngeneration increasing by 182 \nTWh (+4.3%).\nThis rise in 2024 was largely \nthe result of improving \nconditions rather than new \ncapacity. In 2023, the most \nrecent year with available \ncapacity data, hydro capacity \nincreased by only 1.4%, and \nChina was the only country to \ninstall more than 1 gigawatt (GW). \nTotal hydro generation reached an all time high of 4,416 TWh in 2024. The previous high was in 2020, \nwhich was followed by declining total generation in 2021, a small rise in 2022, and again a decline in \n2023. However, it is important to note that hydro capacity factors remain significantly below the ten-\nyear average. While hydro generation in 2024 was 2% higher than the previous record in 2020, \ncapacity has increased by an estimated 7% since then.\nThe share of hydro in global electricity generation was 14.31% in 2024, a fractional increase over 14.27% \nin 2023. However, the share of hydro has been on a slow decline as electricity demand has been \ngrowing faster than hydro generation.\nChina accounted for 71% of the global hydro generation increase in 2024, with its hydro output rising \nby 130 TWh (+11%). Heavy rains saw Chinese hydro generation increase in 2024 after it fell in 2023 due \nto droughts (-72 TWh). In addition to improved conditions, China has continued to add new hydro \ncapacity.\n70\nWhilst rainfall improved in \nChina and Europe, droughts \ncut Brazil’s hydro generation \n(-14 TWh). Canada saw a \nsecond year in a row of poor \nconditions leading to declining \nhydro generation (-17 TWh). US \nhydro generation stayed near \n20-year lows as droughts \ncontinued in the north west.\nChina extended its lead in \nhydro power generation, rising \nto 1,356 TWh in 2024. In 2003, it \nhad the same hydropower \ngeneration as Brazil. In 2024, it \nhad more than three times \nthat of Brazil and four times \nthat of Canada. However, both \nBrazil and Canada rely on \nhydro for about 55% of their \nelectricity generation. In \ncontrast, hydro only \ncontributes 13% to China’s \nelectricity mix.\nHydropower is unique, with many power systems having a near-total reliance on just one source of \nelectricity - the top ten countries get 84% or more of their electricity from hydro. This high level of \nreliance on hydro brings risks related to drought and climate change, with power outages in Ecuador \nproviding a recent example.\nIceland and Norway lead the world in per capita hydro generation with 36,382 kWh and 24,837 kWh \nrespectively.\n71\nNuclear generation rose by 2.5% in 2024\n01\nHowever, nuclear growth continues to lag behind electricity \ndemand growth and its share in the global electricity mix fell to \na 45-year low\n02\nThe rise in 2024 was driven by French units returning from \noutage, some units in Japan returning to service, and a few \nnew units being commissioned globally\n03\nKey highlights\n72\n4.4 Nuclear\nNuclear generation grew in \n2024 (+69 TWh, +2.5%) \nfollowing a similar increase in \n2023 (+59 TWh, +2.2%). Total \nglobal nuclear generation in \n2024 (2,768 TWh) narrowly hit \na record high.\nNuclear made up 9% of the \nglobal electricity mix in 2024, \nthe lowest value in more than \n45 years. Its share has seen \nconsistent declines in the last \ndecade as the rise in nuclear \ngeneration has lagged behind the rise in global electricity demand. \nFour units were closed in 2024, the lowest number in ten years. However, only seven were \ncommissioned in 2024, although construction was started at 11 units, as the global interest in new \nnuclear rises. \nEven as some countries are phasing out nuclear power, global generation from nuclear plants is still \nexpected to rise. Japan is restarting some of its reactors, maintenance works are progressing in \nFrance, and new reactors are due to begin commercial operation in various markets, including China, \nIndia, South Korea and Europe.\nThe country with the largest increase in nuclear generation in 2024 was France (+41 TWh, +12%), where \ngeneration slowly returned to higher levels throughout 2023 and 2024 after outages in 2022.\nChina’s nuclear generation rose by 10 TWh as four new units were commissioned in 2024. The rise of \nnuclear power in China has slowed dramatically from 17% per year from 2000 to 2019, to 5% per year \nfrom 2019 to 2024.\n73\nJapan’s nuclear generation \nrose by 7.5 TWh last year, as 2 \nreactors restarted in 2023 and \ntwo restarted in 2024. Nuclear \ngeneration in the US rose by 7.1 \nTWh. One new unit came \nonline, but there are no further \nreactors under construction as \nof 2024.\nNuclear power generation fell \nby 7.2 TWh in Germany in 2024, \nreflecting the final closures of \nits nuclear fleet in April 2023. \nTaiwan had a decline in nuclear generation for the fifth year in a row (-2.7 TWh) due to its planned \nnuclear phaseout policy.\nThe US continues to be the \nlargest producer of nuclear \npower globally with 782 TWh in \n2024, ahead of China (445 \nTWh), and France (379 TWh). \nOnly three countries rely on \nnuclear power for more than \nhalf of their electricity \ngeneration: France, Slovakia \nand Ukraine.\nA new nuclear power plant \ncommissioned in 2022 meant \nFinland rose to become the country with the highest per capita nuclear generation in 2023 and stayed \nat this spot in 2024, ahead of France.\n74\nGas generation rose by 1.6% to a record high, in part due to \nheatwaves driving increased demand\n01\nGas’s market share has been falling for four years - it peaked \nat 24% in 2020 and fell to 22% in 2024, the lowest since 2013\n02\nThe US was responsible for 43% of the global increase in gas \ngeneration since 2015\n03\nKey highlights\n75\n4.5 Gas\nGlobal gas generation rose by \n1.6% (+103 TWh) to a record \nhigh of 6,788 TWh in 2024. \nDespite this, its market share \nfell for the fourth year in a row, \nas generation rose more \nslowly than electricity demand. \nIts share peaked at 24% in \n2020 and fell to 22% in 2024, \nthe lowest since 2014.\nIn absolute terms, gas \ngeneration has grown by 22% \nsince 2015 (+1,246 TWh), with the US responsible for 43% of this increase.\nThe increase in gas generation \nin the US (+59 TWh) was 57% of \nglobal growth in 2024. Egypt \nhad the second-largest \ngrowth (+15.1 TWh) ahead of \nMexico (+14.8 TWh). In Mexico, \ngas replaced coal and oil \ngeneration. Brazil, Russia and \nSouth Korea also recorded \nlarge increases in gas \ngeneration in 2024 of around \n10 TWh. \nGas generation fell in the UK \n(-14 TWh), Spain (-12 TWh) and France (-11 TWh) as wind and solar generation continued to expand. \nAcross the EU, gas generation was down by 26 TWh, falling for the fifth year in a row. \nIran also recorded a substantial decline of 13 TWh in 2024, reversing an increase of 10 TWh in 2023.\n76\nThe US was the world’s largest \nproducer of electricity from \ngas in 2024, with 1,865 TWh. \nThis was more than three \ntimes larger than Russia, which \nremained in second place at \n538 TWh.\n15 countries generated more \nthan 80% of their electricity \nfrom gas in 2024. These \ncountries are predominately in \nthe Middle East, North Africa \nand Central Asia.\nCountries in the Middle East had the highest per capita gas generation, led by Bahrain (22,986 kWh, \n2023 value as 2024 unavailable) and Qatar (19,190 kWh). This was driven by two factors: a high share \nof gas in their electricity mix and high per capita demand.\n77\nCoal generation rose by 1.4% to a new record in 2024, driven by \nhigh electricity demand growth in part caused by heatwaves\n01\nCoal’s share of global electricity generation fell to 34% in 2024 \nas electricity demand grew faster than coal generation\n02\nChina accounted for 74% of the global increase in coal \ngeneration in 2024\n03\nKey highlights\n78\n4.6 Coal\nGlobal coal generation grew \nby 1.4% (+149 TWh) in 2024, \nrising to a new record high. \nThis increase was slightly \nbelow the rise in 2023 (+190 \nTWh, +1.9%).\nCoal remains the largest single \nsource of electricity \ngeneration. However, coal has \nbeen growing more slowly \nthan electricity demand, \nleading to its share of global \ngeneration falling to 34% in \n2024.\nIn 2015, 59 countries generated at least a fifth of their electricity from coal, which fell to 40 countries in \n2024. \nThe largest increase in coal \ngeneration in 2024 was in \nChina (+110 TWh, +1.9%), which \naccounted for 74% of global \ngrowth in coal generation. \nNotably, this was significantly \nless than China’s 2023 coal \nincrease of 341 TWh, despite \nheatwave-related demand \nspikes driving up China's coal \ngeneration in 2024. Ember's \nanalysis found that 59% of \nChina’s 2024 annual coal \ngeneration growth happened \nin just August and September amid soaring temperatures. The growth in China’s coal generation in \n2024 was suppressed by remarkable solar growth and a strong rebound in hydro generation.\n79\nCoal generation increased in India by 63 TWh (+4.3%) and in Viet Nam by 21 TWh (+16%). Bangladesh \nrecorded a 115% increase in coal generation (+12 TWh) in 2024.\nCoal generation continued to shrink in the US (-22 TWh, -3.3%), although the coal decline in 2023 was \nmuch larger (-156 TWh, -19%). In Germany, coal fell by 21 TWh (-17%) in 2024, even as the country \nclosed its last nuclear plant in 2023. \nOf countries with available data for 2024, 37 showed falls in coal generation.\nChina accounted for 55% of \nglobal coal generation (5,864 \nTWh) in 2024. India produced \nthe second-largest amount of \nelectricity from coal with 1,534 \nTWh, followed by the US with \n653 TWh.\nKosovo had the world’s highest \nshare of coal power in 2024 \n(92%), although its total output \nremains small. Mongolia and \nSouth Africa complete the top \nthree with 86% and 82%, \nrespectively. India produced 75% of its electricity from coal in 2024, more than double the global \naverage of 34%.\nKazakhstan – which was fifth in 2023 — dropped out of the top ten, with its coal share declining from \n67% in 2023 to 55% in 2024. Two countries moved into the top ten in 2024: Serbia and Bosnia \nHerzegovina, both with 63%.\nThe highest coal generation per capita was recorded in Taiwan (5,349 kWh), Australia (4,768 kWh) \nand China (4,132 kWh), which were all more than three times the world average of 1,299 kWh.\n80\nChapter 5: Major Countries and Regions\nData on the world’s seven largest power consumers in 2024, with an \noverview of changes in the last year and trends in the last two decades. \nCollectively, they account for 72% of global electricity demand.\nWe have ordered these countries and regions according to their total electricity \ndemand in 2024. \nChapter contents\n5.1 China \n83\n5.2 United States \n87\n5.3 European Union \n91\n5.4 India \n95\n5.5 Russia \n99\n5.6 Japan \n102\n5.7 Brazil \n106\nAnalysis of key power \nconsumers in 2024\n81\n82\nChina accounted for more than half of the global increase in \nwind and solar power in 2024\n01\nClean generation met 81% of the 2024 demand increase in \nChina\n02\nCoal generation rose to a record high in 2024, but supplied only \n18% of the demand rise and solar grew more than twice as \nmuch\n03\nKey highlights\n83\n5.1 China\nChina’s electricity demand \ncontinued to grow - by 6.6% in \n2024 (+623 TWh), down only \nslightly from 6.9% in 2023.\nDemand growth was given a \ntemporary boost in 2024: \nhotter temperatures \ncontributed significantly to \nhigher cooling demand in the \nsummer months, and January \nand February showed a \nrebound in industrial demand \nfrom lower levels in 2023, as \nthe last Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in early 2023.\n81% of the demand growth was met with the rise in clean generation - wind, solar, hydro, nuclear and \nbioenergy generation all rose. Wind and solar generation combined met more than half of the \nincrease in electricity demand. Just 18% of the increase in demand was met with the rise in coal \ngeneration. \nThe biggest change in China’s electricity generation compared to 2023 was the continued explosive \ngrowth of solar. Solar generation was up 250 TWh (+43%) in 2024 compared to 2023, which had itself \nrecorded an increase of 37% compared to 2022. Also of note was the rebound in hydro generation, \nwhich was up 130 TWh (+11%) in 2024 as the drought conditions of 2023 eased. \nChina had the world’s largest increase in coal generation in 2024 (+110 TWh, +1.9%), but this was less \nthan a third of the increase in 2023 (+341 TWh, +6.3%). This lower level of growth is significant given the \nimpact of heatwaves on increasing demand in 2024. Solar’s increase of 250 TWh was more than twice \nas large as the rise in coal.\nIn 2024, China’s solar growth accounted for 53% of total global solar growth, while China’s 106 TWh of \nwind growth was 58% of the global total.\n84\nElectricity demand in China \nhas increased sevenfold from \n2000 (1,347 TWh) to 2024 \n(10,066 TWh).\nOnly 30% of the demand rise \nfrom 2000 to 2015 was met \nwith rising clean electricity \n(and 70% from fossil sources). \nBut since 2015, over half (53%) \nwas met with clean electricity \n(and 47% from fossil sources). \nWind and solar generation has \ntripled over the past five years, \nfrom 629 TWh in 2019 to 1,826 TWh in 2024. \nCoal’s share has been falling - from 70% in 2015 to 58% in 2024 - even as absolute coal generation set \na new record in 2024, 45% higher than in 2015.\nDespite the growth in solar and wind, China relied on fossil fuels for 62% of its electricity in 2024, \nmaking it the world’s largest power sector emitter. \nTotal power sector emissions rose 2.2% to 5,640 MtCO2 in 2024, lower than the average annual growth \nbetween 2019 and 2023 of 3.9%. Forecasts suggest that China is approaching the tipping point on coal \ngeneration and that peak emissions are on the horizon (read more about this in Chapter 2.3). China \naccounted for 39% of global power sector emissions in 2024.\nChina plays an outsized role in the global electricity transition. It has over half of the world’s coal-fired \ninstalled capacity, and is simultaneously home to over 80% of the global solar manufacturing \nindustry. China dominates the global growth in wind and solar generation, accounting for 54% in 2024, \nbut also the global growth in coal generation, accounting for 74%.\nClean power made up 38% (3,836 TWh) of China’s electricity mix in 2024, just below the global \naverage of 41%. Hydro was the largest single source of clean power at 13.5% (1,356 TWh).\n85\nChina’s wind and solar \ngeneration hit a new record \nshare of 18% (1,826 TWh) in \n2024, remaining above the \nglobal average of 15% and \novertaking the US for the first \ntime. China‘s clean share and \nwind and solar share both \nremain above the average \nclean share and wind and \nsolar share in Asia.\nChina’s coal share of 58% \n(5,864 TWh) remains just \nabove the regional average of 54% and significantly above the global average of 34%. In 2024, China \nwas responsible for 55% of global coal generation.\nChina’s carbon intensity of \nelectricity generation was 560 \ngCO2/kWh, down 4.1% from \n2023, but still significantly \nabove the global average of \n473 gCO2/kWh due to its \ndependence on coal.\nChina’s per-capita electricity \ndemand of 7.1 MWh was \nalmost double the global \naverage (3.8 MWh) and the \nregional average (3.7 MWh). \nChina’s demand per capita \nwas five times India’s in 2024. \nDue to its growing per capita demand and high reliance on coal generation, China’s per capita power \nsector emissions (4 tCO2) remained at more than double the global average of 1.8 tCO2 and the \naverage in Asia of 2.1 tCO2. \n86\nIn 2024, wind and solar together generated more electricity in \nthe US than coal for the first time, with coal’s share in the mix \nfalling to an all-time low of under 15%\n01\nGas generation rose as electricity demand accelerated, with \nthe US accounting for more than half (57%) of global growth in \ngas generation in 2024\n02\nSolar generation rose more than gas, recording its highest ever \nannual increase of 64 TWh\n03\nKey highlights\n87\n5.2 United States\nElectricity demand in the \nUnited States grew by 3% (+128 \nTWh) in 2024, caused partly by \nheatwaves over the summer \nmonths and partly as a \nrebound from a milder \nsummer in 2023 when demand \ndecreased by 1.3% (-55 TWh).\nThe demand rise was \npredominantly met with higher \nsolar, wind and gas \ngeneration, which also made \nup for a fall in coal generation \n(-22 TWh).\n2024 saw the largest-ever increase in solar generation in the US (+64 TWh). This was the second-\nlargest increase of any country, after China. Significant capacity additions spurred by the Inflation \nReduction Act have begun to feed through to generation increases. Wind generation rose as a result \nof improved wind conditions from 2023 as well as a moderate increase in wind capacity.\nGas generation in the US increased by 3.3% (+59 TWh). This was the largest rise in gas generation \nseen in any country in 2024 and more than half (57%) of the global increase in gas generation.\nCoal power has been in terminal decline in the US since its peak in 2007. Since then, coal power has \nfallen by two-thirds (-1,364 TWh). Coal fell below 15% of the US electricity mix for the first time in 2024. \nCoal power was predominantly replaced by an increase in wind and solar generation (+722 TWh \nsince 2007) and gas generation (+968 TWh since 2007). Gas generation rose to record levels in 2024, \ndoubling compared to 2007. The US has been responsible for 43% of the global increase in gas \ngeneration since 2015.\nThe partial coal-to-gas switch meant that power sector emissions have not declined as fast as coal \npower. Since 2015, emissions have fallen by 18%, from 2,062 MtCO2 to 1,683 MtCO2 in 2024. \n88\nWind and solar together have \nmore than tripled (+527 TWh) \nin the US since 2015, \ngenerating 757 TWh of \nelectricity in 2024. This \ncontinued growth meant that \nwind and solar overtook coal \npower in the US for the first \ntime in 2024, generating 17% of \nthe country’s electricity. \nAfter remaining largely flat for \nmost of the 2010s, demand has \nrisen in three of the last four \nyears, at an average of 1.8% per year.\nThe growth in clean electricity came only from solar and wind – bioenergy, nuclear and hydro \ngeneration were all lower in 2024 than in 2015.\nThe United States generated \n42% of its electricity from clean \nsources in 2024, in line with the \nglobal average. 17% of the \ncountry’s electricity was \ngenerated by wind and solar \npower, which was just above \nthe global average (15%), but \nlower than China (18%).\n58% of US electricity came \nfrom fossil fuels in 2024, which \nwas in line with the global \naverage of 59% despite coal’s \nsignificant decline. This was due to the country’s reliance on gas power, which supplied 43% of its \nelectricity in 2024 (1,865 TWh). This was more than double the gas generation of all other G7 members \ncombined.\n89\nThe carbon intensity of US \nelectricity generation was 384 \ngCO2/kWh - below the global \naverage of 473 gCO2/kWh. \nAlthough the fossil share was \nsimilar to the global average, \nthe US has a larger reliance on \ngas than coal, leading to \ncarbon intensity. \nThe United States was the \ncountry with the 11th highest \nelectricity demand per capita \n(12.7 MWh) in 2024. Its demand \nper capita has remained consistently high and in 2024, reached its highest level since 2014. Its \ndemand per capita is twice as high as that of the EU.\nAs a result of high electricity demand, power sector emissions per capita were 4.9 tCO2, more than \ndouble the global average of 1.8 tCO2. \n90\nSolar power overtook coal generation in the EU for the first time \nin 2024\n01\nIn 2024, the EU saw the largest fall in coal generation globally\n02\nThe EU's biggest two generation sources – nuclear and wind – \nare both low-carbon, with gas and coal in third and sixth place \nrespectively\n03\nKey highlights\n91\n5.3 European Union\nIn 2024, solar was the \nEuropean Union’s fastest-\ngrowing power source, with a \n21% increase (+53 TWh) \ncompared to 2023. This rise \naccounted for 11% of the global \nincrease in solar generation. \nThe EU saw a record amount of \nnew capacity additions in \n2024, driving this solar \nincrease despite lower solar \nradiation in 2024 than in 2023. \nWind generation grew by 8 \nTWh year-on-year in 2024. This growth is lower than the average 30 TWh year-on-year increase seen \nbetween 2019 and 2023. While capacity additions continued in 2024, wind conditions were less \nfavourable than in 2023, leading to lower than expected generation.\nHydro and nuclear generation increased by 32 TWh (+9.6%) and 29 TWh (+4.6%) respectively. Hydro \nincreased due to favorable rainfall across most of Europe, while nuclear power was boosted because \nof reduced downtime in France.\nFossil gas generation fell for the fifth year in a row (-26 TWh, -5.6%). Coal generation in the EU fell by \n50 TWh (-16%), continuing a second consecutive year of decline. This was the largest decline in any \npower sector globally.\nEU demand rose by 30 TWh (+1.1%), steadying after large falls in 2022 and 2023.\nThe EU has proven that a deep transformation of the power sector is achievable and beneficial. In \n2024, EU power sector emissions were down to 585 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), below half of their \n2007 peak.\n92\nOver the last five years, coal \ngeneration has fallen by 182 TWh \n(-40%), with Austria, Sweden \nand Portugal phasing it out \ncompletely, while countries with \nlarge coal fleets like Germany \nsaw significant plant closures. \nAt the same time, gas \ngeneration has decreased in \neach of the last five years, and \nwas 139 TWh (-24%) lower in \n2024 than it was in 2019. The \nreduction in gas generation has \nenhanced the bloc’s energy \nsecurity amidst Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the gas price volatility seen over the last three years. \nEU fossil generation is now at its lowest level for more than forty years (793 TWh).\nThe key driver of this has been a significant rise in wind and solar generation. Wind and solar’s share \nin the EU power mix has increased from 17% in 2019 to 29% in 2024, with wind generation increasing by \n113 TWh (+31%) and solar generation by 179 TWh (+143%).\nHydropower capacity has remained unchanged over the last five years, with changes in generation \ndominated by weather conditions. Meanwhile, nuclear capacity has decreased from 110 GW to 96 GW, \nalthough the largest changes in generation have come from outages and maintenance.\nAs a result of its power sector transformation, the EU has cemented its position as a global leader in \nclean power, showing it is possible to integrate high shares of variable renewables. 71% of the region’s \nelectricity came from clean sources in 2024, far above the global average of 41%. The EU's biggest two \ngeneration sources – nuclear and wind – are both low-carbon, with gas and coal in third and sixth \nplace respectively.\nThe EU obtained 18% of its electricity from wind power, more than double the global average. Solar \nprovided 11% of the EU’s electricity generation in 2024, surpassing coal for the first time ever. Out of the \n15 countries with the highest solar shares in 2024, seven were EU Member States. France’s sizeable \n93\nnuclear fleet meant that the \nbloc generated 24% of its \nelectricity from nuclear power, \nabove the global average.\nFossil generation provided 29% \nof the EU’s electricity, half of \nthe global average of 59%. The \nmain difference was a much \nlower share of coal generation. \nCoal generation fell to below \n10% (9.8%) of total EU electricity \ngeneration, compared to the \nglobal average of 34%.\nThe carbon intensity of \nelectricity generation in the EU \nwas 213 gCO2 per kWh in 2024, \nless than half the global \naverage (473 gCO2/kWh). \nThe EU’s per capita power \ndemand was 6.1 MWh, 60% \nhigher than the world average \nand half the demand per \ncapita of the United States.\nThe low CO2 intensity and \ndemand per capita meant \nthat the EU’s per capita power sector emissions were 1.3 tonnes of CO2 (tCO2), 28% less than the world \naverage of 1.8 tCO2 and about one third of those in China and the United States.\n94\nIndia’s wind and solar generation doubled in the five years \nleading to 2024\n01\nIndia overtook Germany to become the world's third largest \ngenerator of electricity from wind and solar in 2024\n02\nCoal generation growth met 64% of India’s electricity demand \ngrowth in 2024, a substantial decline from the 91% in 2023\n03\nKey highlights\n95\n5.4 India\nIndia’s power demand \nincreased by 5% (98 TWh) in \n2024, slightly less than the 7% \ngrowth in 2023, and in line with \nthe country’s average annual \ndemand growth rate for the \nlast decade (+5.5%). India had \nthe third-largest demand \nincrease in the world.\nClean generation increased by \n32 TWh (+7.4%) in 2024, \nmeeting 33% of India’s \ndemand increase. The clean \ngeneration increase was in part due to a rebound of hydro (+7 TWh, +4.7%) after a decline of 26 TWh \nin 2023. \nIndia recorded the fourth-largest increase in solar generation of any country in 2024 at 20 TWh (+18%), \nmore than the total solar generation of the United Kingdom. This was driven by record capacity \nadditions in 2024, more than double the additions in 2023. However, lower solar radiation meant that \nthe generation increase seen in 2024 did not fully reflect the impact of this capacity boom. \nFossil generation increased by 67 TWh (+4.4%) in 2024, significantly lower than 2023’s figure of 124 TWh \n(+8.8%). Coal generation grew by 4.3% in 2024, almost half the average of the prior three years (8.8%). \nCoal generation growth met 64% of India’s electricity demand growth in 2024, a substantial decline \nfrom the 91% in 2023.\nIndia’s demand had been rising by more than 7% every year since the Covid-19 decline of 2020, but in \n2024, demand growth fell back to the historic ten-year trend of around 5%.\nIndia’s wind and solar generation almost doubled over the five years leading to 2024, from 110 TWh to \n215 TWh. As a result, India overtook Germany in 2024 to become the world’s third largest generator of \nelectricity from wind and solar. Hydro generation in 2024 was roughly the same as five years ago, and \nnuclear power increased by 10 TWh (+21%) over the same period. \n96\nIndia’s coal-fired power \ngeneration also continued to \nrise, almost doubling from 2012 \n(787 TWh) to 2024 (1,534 TWh). \nIn 2018, India overtook the US to \nbecome the second-largest \ncoal generator, and now has \nmore than twice the coal \ngeneration of the US.\nAs a result, power sector \nemissions continue to rise, \nreaching 1,457 MtCO2 in 2024. \nThis makes India the world’s \nthird-largest power sector emitter, although emissions per capita remain well below the global \naverage. \nIndia is one of only ten \ncountries that is currently \nplanning for a tripling of \nrenewables capacity by 2030 \n(from 2022), with the goal of \nreaching 500 GW of clean \npower capacity. By October \n2024, the country had \nachieved 200 GW of RE \ncapacity. India is focused on \ndomestic policies that support \nsolar modules, batteries, and \nelectrolysers to support the \nenergy transition, while \nmeeting development milestones such as the recent delivery of 100% electricity access.\nIndia generated 78% of its electricity from fossil sources in 2024, primarily driven by coal at 75%. This is \nabove the 66% regional average for Asia and well above the 59% global average. \n97\nClean generation made up 22% of India’s electricity mix in 2024. Hydro was India’s largest clean \nelectricity source at 8%. Solar and wind combined reached 10% in 2024. However, this is still below the \nglobal average (15%) and China (18%).\nThe carbon intensity of India’s \npower sector was 708 gCO2/\nkWh in 2024. This is higher than \nboth the average in Asia of 573 \ngCO2/kWh and the global \naverage of 473 gCO2/kWh.\nDespite having the third-\nhighest demand of any \ncountry, the electricity \ndemand per capita was 1.4 \nMWh, less than half of the \nAsian regional average of 3.7 \nMWh and the global average \nof 3.8 MWh.  \nIndia’s electricity is heavily coal-reliant. However, the low per capita electricity use meant that India’s \nper capita emissions were 1 tCO2, much lower than the global average (1.8 tCO2).\n98\nRussia set a new record high for both coal and gas generation \nin 2024\n01\nWind and solar accounted for less than 1% of Russia’s \nelectricity mix, the second-lowest share in the G20\n02\nThe carbon intensity of Russia’s electricity generation in 2024 \nremained unchanged from a decade ago\n03\nKey highlights\n99\n5.5 Russia\nDemand in Russia grew by 32 \nTWh (+2.8%) in 2024, lower \nthan the global demand \nincrease of 4%. Excluding the \n5.7% rise in 2021, following the \nCovid-19 pandemic, this was \nRussia’s highest demand \nincrease since 2010. Fossil \ngeneration met most of this \nincrease, with a 14 TWh (+6.7%) \ncoal rise and a gas increase of \n9.8 TWh (+1.9%). \nHydro increased by 9.5 TWh \n(+4.7%) in 2024, following a 3.2 TWh (+1.6%) increase in 2023. Nuclear saw a small decline of 1.7 TWh (-\n0.8%) in 2024. \nWind and solar only play a small role in Russian generation. Wind saw a 0.8 TWh increase and solar \ngeneration grew by 0.2 TWh. \nRussia set a new record for \nboth coal and gas generation \nin 2024, with fossil generation \ncontinuing to meet growing \nelectricity demand. As a result, \nRussia was the world’s fourth-\nlargest power sector emitter \nwith a total of 544 million \ntonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) in \n2024. \nPower sector emissions in \nRussia had been relatively flat \nfrom 2013 until they dropped \ndue to Covid-19 restrictions in 2020, but have been on a steady increase since then. Emissions were \nup by 20 MtCO2 in 2024, an increase of 3.8% over 2023, more than double the global average. \n100\nNuclear and hydro generation have been rising in Russia. In 2024, nuclear generation was 10% higher \nthan in 2015, though falling slightly in market share. Partly due to higher rainfall, hydro generation was \n25% higher in 2024 compared to 2015. Solar and wind remained a tiny part of the electricity mix. \nRussia has not started its clean \nenergy transition. Its share of \nwind and solar generation \ncombined was less than 1% of \nits total power mix, the \nsecond-lowest in the G20. \nRussia lags well behind the \nEuropean average (20%), \nChina (18%), and the global \naverage of 15%. \nFossil fuels made up 64% of \nRussia’s electricity mix in 2024. \nGas made up the largest share \nat 44%, followed by coal which accounted for 19% of the country’s electricity generation. Clean power \nmade up 36% of the electricity mix with nearly all of it coming from hydro and nuclear, contributing \n17% and 18% respectively.\nRussia’s carbon intensity of \nelectricity was 449 gCO2/kWh in \n2024, just below the global \naverage of 473 gCO2/kWh. \nRussia’s demand per capita was \n8.3 MWh, more than twice the \nglobal average of 3.8 MWh. \nAs a result of the relatively high \ndemand, Russia’s power sector \nemissions per capita in 2024 \nwere 3.8 tCO2, more than double \nthe global average of 1.8 tCO2. \n101\nWind power has grown significantly in all G7 countries except \nJapan\n01\nJapan remained the fourth-largest solar generating country \nglobally\n02\nJapan’s power sector emissions fell by 1.4% in 2024\n03\nKey highlights\n102\n5.6 Japan\nIn 2024, Japan’s power \ndemand increased by 9 TWh \n(+0.9%), in part as a result of \nhotter temperatures in \nsummer months. Fossil \ngeneration fell by 12 TWh (-\n1.7%). This was much lower \nthan the fall in fossil \ngeneration in 2023 (-63 TWh, -\n8%).\nJapan’s clean generation \ngrowth was led by an increase \nin nuclear generation (+7.5 \nTWh, +9.6%) and solar (+5 TWh, +5.2%). Overall clean generation was up by 21 TWh (+7%), just over half \nof the increase in 2023 (+36 TWh; +13.6%).\nJapan’s power sector \nemissions peaked in 2012 and \nhave declined 25% since then, \nreaching 493 million tonnes of \nCO2 (MtCO2) in 2024. This was \nthe lowest value in the past 22 \nyears, but still slightly higher \nthan in 2000. This is because \ncoal and gas still generate \naround two-thirds of Japan’s \nelectricity, though in recent \nyears they have been \nincreasingly replaced by \nnuclear and solar.\nSolar’s share in the mix has grown significantly in Japan, rising fivefold from 2% of generation in 2014 to \n10% in 2024. On the other hand, wind was just 1% of generation in 2024. This is in stark contrast to the \nrest of the G7, where wind has risen to an average of 12% of total electricity generation. \n103\nNuclear generation has grown in recent years owing to the reopening of reactors closed following the \nFukushima nuclear disaster. Two units reopened in 2024. However, due to the slow recovery of nuclear \npower and the lack of wind power, Japan produced less clean electricity in 2024 (322 TWh) than it did \nin 2000 (420 TWh).\nJapan’s largest source of \nclean electricity was solar \n(10%) in 2024. However, despite \nsignificant wind potential, its \nshare of wind is only 1%. As a \nresult, the wind and solar share \nwas only 11% in 2024, below the \nglobal average (15%), regional \naverage (14%), and its \nneighbour China (18%). \nIn 2024, Japan relied on fossil \nfuels for 69% of electricity \ngeneration. This is more than \nthe regional average of 66% and global average of 59%. \nThe share of nuclear in electricity generation was 8.3%, up from 7.6% in 2023 due to the restart of \nadditional nuclear reactors in 2024. There are currently 10 reactors under review for potential restart, \nand the recent 7th long-term strategic energy plan aims for 20% nuclear share in generation by 2040.\nThe carbon intensity of Japan’s power sector was 482 gCO2/kWh in 2024, virtually unchanged from \n2023, and just above the global average of 473 gCO2/kWh. Due to the lower contribution of coal in \nJapan as compared to most of Asia, its carbon intensity was lower than the Asian regional average of \n573 gCO2/kWh.\n104\nHowever, Japan’s emissions \nper capita of 4 tCO2 were \nmore than twice the global \naverage of 1.8 tCO2 and \nalmost twice the regional \naverage of 2.1 tCO2. This is \nprimarily due to Japan’s large \ndemand per capita at 8.3 \nMWh.\n105\nIn 2024, Brazil had the world's third-largest increase in both \nwind and solar generation \n01\nBrazil has overtaken Germany to become the fifth-largest \nsolar generator\n02\nBrazil’s power sector emissions peaked a decade ago, and in \n2024 were down 32% from 2014\n03\nKey highlights\n106\n5.7 Brazil\nElectricity demand in Brazil \nwas up by 35 TWh (+4.9%) in \n2024, similar to the demand \nincrease in 2023 (+35 TWh, \n+5%). Both years’ increases \nwere triple that of 2022 (+11 \nTWh, +1.6%). \nBrazil’s demand increase was \nprimarily met by solar (+23 \nTWh, +45%) and wind (+12 \nTWh, +13%). Its increase in solar \ngeneration was the third-\nlargest of any country in 2024.\nBrazil became the fifth-largest solar generator in 2024, surpassing Germany in the global rankings. \nBrazil also had the third-largest increase in wind generation in 2024, maintaining its fourth place \nglobally in terms of total annual wind generation.\nHydro generation was down 14 TWh (-3.2%) in 2024 due to an intense and widespread drought. Brazil’s \nfossil generation increased by 12 TWh (+18%), primarily due to gas increasing by 10 TWh (+27%), \ncountering the fall in hydro generation.\nBrazil has a high share of \nrenewables due to its large \nhydroelectric base and the \nrapid expansion of solar and \nwind power in recent years. Its \nshare of wind and solar has \nbeen growing rapidly in recent \nyears, reaching 24% in 2024, a \nsubstantial increase from 17% \nin 2022 and up from just 5.8% \nin 2016.\n107\nBrazil’s power sector emissions peaked in 2014 at 114 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2). Growing wind and \nsolar have since reduced the need for fossil power. In 2024, a decade past the peak, its power sector \nemissions were 32% below 2014 levels, at 77 MtCO2.\nBrazil’s power sector emissions have fluctuated since the peak due to variability in weather conditions, \nwith rainfall and drought affecting hydro output. In 2024, drier conditions prevailed and overall, there \nwas a slight decline in hydro generation (-14 TWh) that was almost all offset by rising fossil generation \n(+12 TWh) such that power sector emissions increased slightly from 2023 to 2024 (+8 MtCO2).  \nBrazil generated 90% of its \nelectricity from clean sources \nin 2024, with hydro dominating \nthe mix at 56%. Its share of \nwind and solar (24%) was \nabove the global average \n(15%) and the average in Latin \nAmerica (17%).\nOver 87% of Brazil’s electricity \ncame from renewables in \n2024, which was by far the \nhighest of any G20 country \nand almost triple the global \naverage of 32%.\nBrazil relied on fossil fuels for just 10% of its electricity in 2024, a sixth of the global average of 59%.\nIn 2024, Brazil’s carbon intensity of electricity generation was 103 gCO2/kWh, the second-lowest in the \nG20 and less than a quarter of the global average (473 gCO2/kWh).\nBrazil’s electricity demand per capita was 3.6 MWh in 2024, just below the world average of 3.8 MWh \nbut above the regional average of 2.8 MWh. \n108\nBrazil’s per capita emissions \nfrom electricity generation (0.4 \ntCO2) are the lowest in the G20 \nand less than a quarter of the \nglobal average of 1.8 tCO2.\n109\nConclusion\nIn a world of higher electricity demand growth, clean electricity is \nstepping up to the challenge. Spearheaded by exponential solar \nexpansion, clean power is set to grow faster than demand, marking the \nstart of a permanent decline in fossil generation.\n2024 both clarified and consolidated the shape of the global clean power transition. At first \nglance it might appear an unremarkable year, as global fossil generation increased for \nanother year. However, the main driver of this increase was the change in temperature \nbetween 2024 and 2023. Stripping out these temperature effects, clean generation met 96% \nof the demand increase in 2024. Isolating the trend from the short-term fluctuations, it \nbecomes clear that the world is very close to an era of falling fossil fuel generation.\n2024 also cemented solar power as the engine of the global energy transition. Global solar \ngeneration increased by nearly a third, continuing its lead as the largest and fastest-\ngrowing source of new electricity. Its rise was on display everywhere in 2024, from world \nleaders like China, India, Brazil and the EU to new markets in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The \nstartling expansion and cost reduction of battery storage offer another positive, enhancing \nthe economics of solar power still further.\nNew drivers of demand – data centres for AI and cryptomining, and electrified transport and \nheating – raise pressing questions about how to meet rising power consumption. 2024 has \nshown that solar and batteries, the new engines of growth, are best placed to deliver \ncheaply and at scale, and are already doing so. While demand growth is undoubtedly going \nClean power poised to begin \nthe era of fossil fuel decline\n110\nto be higher than in previous years, Ember’s analysis shows that clean growth is set to \noutpace it, making long-term investments to grow fossil generation a risky bet. \nAny near-term increases in fossil fuel generation should not be mistaken for failure of the \nenergy transition. As we pass the tipping point where clean generation structurally outpaces \ndemand growth, any changes to fossil fuel generation over the short-term will mostly reflect \nfluctuations in weather, as seen in 2024 with the impacts of heatwaves. But while changes in \nfossil generation in the short-term may be noisy, the direction and ultimate destination are \nunmistakable. The global energy transition is no longer a question of if, but how fast. \nThe significant advances of 2024 were achieved despite unfavourable geopolitical \nheadwinds. In 2025 those winds are strengthening again, with an increased prospect of \ntariffs on international trade and a US administration pinning its energy hopes on fossil fuels. \nHowever, while playing an important role, the US is not the central driver of the global clean \nenergy transition – this role has fallen more and more to China. China registered more than \nhalf of the global increase in both solar and wind power in 2024 and is the world leader in \nboth clean energy manufacturing and deployment. There is no indication that China is \nslowing its own transition to an electrified economy, nor that its trade relationships with other \nGlobal South countries will do anything but intensify.\nBeyond China, the rapid clean energy build registered by India, Brazil and the EU is a sign \nthat other major economies are forging ahead. Notably, India is rapidly expanding its own \nsolar and battery manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, uncertainties over trade relations with \nthe US are likely to increase many governments’ appetite for the clean energy transition, in \nregions including Europe and Latin America, because it offers a route to reduced \ndependence on volatile global markets for coal and gas. \nThe imperative for the energy transition is clear: the world is upgrading from an inefficient \nenergy system reliant on securing a constant supply of expensive and polluting fossil fuels. In \nthe new energy system, electricity will be at the heart, with clean electrons powering \neverything from transport to steel production. Solar and wind, backed by a suite of clean \nflexibility solutions like improved grids and storage, will be the engine powering the world. \n2024 shows unmistakably that the transition to this new energy system is very much \nunderway. Governments and businesses that act decisively to embrace clean energy and \nquickly move away from fossil fuels will be rewarded with a more resilient, competitive, and \nsecure energy future.\n111\nSupporting materials\nGeneration, imports and demand\nYearly data from 2000 to 2023 is gross generation, taken primarily from the Energy Institute’s \nStatistical Review of World Energy, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), Eurostat and \nIRENA. 2024 data is an estimate of gross generation, based on generation gathered from \nmonthly data. This estimate is calculated by applying absolute changes in monthly \ngeneration to the most recent annual baseline.\nNet imports from 1990 to 2023 are taken from the EIA and Eurostat, with recent data \nestimated in the same manner as generation. Demand is calculated as the sum of \ngeneration and net imports, and where possible validated against published direct demand \nfigures. Because it uses gross generation and does not include transmission and distribution \nlosses, it will tend to be higher than end-user demand. \nMonthly data is gathered for 88 countries from over 70 sources, including national \ntransmission system operators and statistical agencies, as well as data aggregators such as \nENTSO-E. In some cases, data is published on a monthly lag; here we have estimated recent \nmonths based on our generation model.\nMonthly data is often reported provisionally, and is far from perfect. Every effort has been \nmade to ensure accuracy, and where possible we compare multiple sources to confirm their \nagreement.\nMethodology\n112\nBioenergy has typically been assumed (by the IPCC, the IEA, and many others) to be a \nrenewable energy source, in that forest and energy crops can be regrown and replenished, \nunlike fossil fuels. It is included in many governmental climate targets, including EU \nrenewable energy legislation, and so Ember includes it in “renewable” to allow easy \ncomparison with legislated targets. However, we recognise the IPCC reported lifecycle \ncarbon intensity of bioenergy is significantly higher than other renewables and nuclear, and \nthis is incorporated into our power sector emissions estimate. More information about \nEmber’s classification of electricity sources can be found in the full methodology for Ember’s \nYearly Electricity Data under “Fuel Types”.\nReferences to CO2 emissions in this report are using CO2 equivalent emissions which include \nemissions from other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4). Power sector emissions \nare based on the methodology from Ember’s Yearly Electricity Data which can be found here.\nCalculation of temperature impacts on electricity demand\nThis methodology outlines the approach used to quantify the impact of temperature on \nglobal electricity demand. By using regression analysis with temperature data and monthly \nelectricity demand, this analysis isolates temperature-driven variations from structural \nchanges in electricity consumption.\nGeographic coverage\nThe analysis aims to deliver a global level account of temperature effects on demand. For \nthis purpose, it includes country/region-level analysis for 14 countries and regions. The \nanalysis was carried out for Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, India, Iran, Japan, Mexico, \nRussia, South Africa, South Korea, Türkiye, the United Kingdom and the United States. \nTogether, these power sectors accounted for 82% of global electricity demand. The assessed \nimpact in included countries is scaled to match 100% of global demand.\nData Sources\nMeteorological Data: Temperature data was sourced from the ERA5 reanalysis via Open-\nMeteo, providing hourly 2-metre temperature.\nElectricity Demand Data: Monthly electricity demand data was obtained from Ember’s \nMonthly Electricity data.\n113\nPopulation Data: Population figures were derived from NASA’s Gridded Population of the \nWorld dataset, with a resolution of 0.25 degrees (~30 km).\nTime Period: The analysis of temperature effects covers the period from 2015 to 2024, \ndepending on the availability of data for each country.\nNormalising Monthly Electricity Demand\nMonthly electricity demand was normalised by dividing observed demand by its 12-month \ntrailing average. This process helps to minimise the influence of long-term structural factors \nsuch as economic growth or increased electrification, isolating seasonal and temperature-\nrelated changes.\nTemperature Data\nA 1-degree resolution grid was created for each country. Population data was assigned to \neach grid cell, and hourly temperature data was extracted for the centre of each cell.\nPopulation Weighting for temperature and CDD/HDD values\nPopulation weighted temperatures were calculated by weighting temperature for each grid \ncell by the corresponding population.\nSimilarly, cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD) values were calculated \nand weighted using the same approach. This ensures that temperature metrics reflect \nconditions in populated areas, where electricity demand is concentrated. It also accounts for \nthe non-linear relationship between temperature and energy use. Cooling degree days and \nHeating degree days were defined as follows:\n• \nCooling degree days (CDD): The sum of degrees by which daily temperatures exceed \n22°C, reflecting cooling demand.\n• \nHeating degree days (HDD): The sum of degrees by which daily temperatures fall \nbelow 18°C, reflecting heating demand.\nRegression Analysis\nTo understand the relationship between temperature and electricity demand, we used \nregression analysis to identify how changes in temperature, measured through cooling \ndegree days and heating degree days, influence electricity demand per country. The \n114\nanalysis helps quantify the extent to which higher or lower temperatures drive changes in \nmonthly electricity use.\nCalculating Anomalies\nMonthly temperature, HDD and CDD anomalies were calculated with respect to a ten-year \nbaseline (2015-2024). Using a relatively short and recent baseline makes the anomalies \nmore relevant to recent changes in electricity demand.\nCalculating Absolute Impact\nThe impact of temperature on demand was derived by applying the identified relationship of \nCDD and HDD data and monthly electricity demand to the CDD and HDD anomalies. These \nwere then scaled by normalised demand into absolute impacts in TWh. For some countries, \nmonthly demand reporting can be lower than annual reported values. Where applicable, \ntemperature impact values derived from monthly data were scaled to match annual \ndemand figures. Combined country level assessments for the 15 included regions were \naggregated and scaled to match total global electricity demand of all countries in 2024.\nDemand disaggregation\nElectricity demand growth from EVs is estimated from changes in EV stock by vehicle type, \nmultiplied by reference values for electricity consumption by vehicle type. Vehicle types \ninclude passenger cars, buses, trucks and vans, for both battery electric vehicles and plug-in \nhybrid electric vehicles. Historic stock data is taken from the IEA’s Global EV Data Explorer. \nDemand growth in 2024 is estimated using sales data for passenger cars taken from BNEF, \nand assumes recent growth rates are maintained across other vehicle types.\nElectricity demand growth from data centres (including cryptocurrency mining) is estimated \nusing IEA data. As IEA data only goes back to 2019, the same value for demand growth was \nused in 2019 as in 2020, based on the assumption that growth at this point in time was linear \n(see assessment of historic estimates from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). For \n2023-2024, IEA projections for cryptocurrency mining have been substituted for real data \nfrom Cambridge University’s Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) to \nmore accurately estimate cryptocurrency mining electricity consumption growth for recent \nyears. The estimates for cryptocurrency mining electricity demand growth are estimated \nusing growth in Bitcoin electricity demand, scaled to fit estimates for total crypto demand in \n115\n2022. Bitcoin makes up the large majority of proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining activity \nand other cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-stake mechanisms use considerably less \nenergy. \nElectricity demand growth from heat pumps is estimated using changes in stock data, \nmultiplied by annual average consumption. Data for 2024 assumes that the reduction in \nsales in key markets seen in the first half of 2024 continued throughout the rest of the year.\nOther data sources\nThis report makes use of a variety of datasets curated by Ember, including data on exports \nof Chinese solar PV modules and global solar capacity installations.\nA full methodology for Ember’s data on exports of Chinese solar PV modules can be found \nhere.\nSolar capacity additions are estimated using available monthly capacity data from national \nsources for countries that made up 80% of solar capacity additions in 2023. National monthly \ndata is generally available for all of 2024, with exceptions for a few countries where the final \nmonths of 2024 are estimates based on market growth rates in available months. Estimates \nfor remaining countries are made through analysis of Chinese solar PV module export data. \nA full methodology can be found here.\n116\nLead Authors\nNicolas Fulghum, Euan Graham\nOther authors\nKatye Altieri\nData visualisation\nChelsea Bruce-Lockhart, Lauren Orso\nProject Manager\nJosie Murdoch\nEditors\nRichard Black, Hannah Broadbent\nOther contributors\nAditya Lolla, Ardhi Arsala Rahmani, Beatrice Petrovich, Claire Kaelin, Dave Jones, Eva \nMbengue, Kavya Sharma, Libby Copsey, Matt Ewen, Neha Rajput, Phil MacDonald, Rashmi \nMishra, Reynaldo Dizon, Rini Sucahyo, Sachin Sreejith, Sam Hawkins.\nPeer reviewers\nA.K.

DL allows analysis of unstructured data and automated identiﬁcation\nof features. The recent development of large materials databases has fueled the application of DL methods in atomistic prediction\nin particular. In contrast, advances in image and spectral data have largely leveraged synthetic data enabled by high-quality\nforward models as well as by generative unsupervised DL methods. In this article, we present a high-level overview of deep learning\nmethods followed by a detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic simulation, materials imaging,\nspectral analysis, and natural language processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and\nexperimental data, typical modeling approaches with their strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and\ndatasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting work related to uncertainty quantiﬁcation in this ﬁeld\nand a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods in materials science.\nnpj Computational Materials  (2022) 8:59 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-022-00734-6\nINTRODUCTION\n“Processing-structure-property-performance” is the key mantra in\nMaterials Science and Engineering (MSE)1. The length and time\nscales of material structures and phenomena vary signiﬁcantly\namong these four elements, adding further complexity2. For\ninstance, structural information can range from detailed knowl-\nedge of atomic coordinates of elements to the microscale spatial\ndistribution of phases (microstructure), to fragment connectivity\n(mesoscale), to images and spectra. Establishing linkages between\nthe above components is a challenging task.\nBoth experimental and computational techniques are useful to\nidentify such relationships. Due to rapid growth in automation in\nexperimental equipment and immense expansion of computa-\ntional resources, the size of public materials datasets has seen\nexponential growth. Several large experimental and computa-\ntional datasets3–10 have been developed through the Materials\nGenome Initiative (MGI)11 and the increasing adoption of Findable,\nAccessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR)12 principles. Such an\noutburst of data requires automated analysis which can be\nfacilitated by machine learning (ML) techniques13–20.\nDeep learning (DL)21,22 is a specialized branch of machine\nlearning\n(ML).\nOriginally\ninspired\nby\nbiological\nmodels\nof\ncomputation and cognition in the human brain23,24, one of DL’s\nmajor strengths is its potential to extract higher-level features\nfrom the raw input data.\nDL applications are rapidly replacing conventional systems in\nmany aspects of our daily lives, for example, in image and speech\nrecognition, web search, fraud detection, email/spam ﬁltering,\nﬁnancial risk modeling, and so on. DL techniques have been\nproven to provide exciting new capabilities in numerous ﬁelds\n(such as playing Go25, self-driving cars26, navigation, chip design,\nparticle physics, protein science, drug discovery, astrophysics,\nobject recognition27, etc).\nRecently DL methods have been outperforming other machine\nlearning\ntechniques\nin\nnumerous\nscientiﬁc\nﬁelds,\nsuch\nas\nchemistry, physics, biology, and materials science20,28–32. DL\napplications in MSE are still relatively new, and the ﬁeld has not\nfully explored its potential, implications, and limitations. DL\nprovides new approaches for investigating material phenomena\nand has pushed materials scientists to expand their traditional\ntoolset.\nDL methods have been shown to act as a complementary\napproach to physics-based methods for materials design. While\nlarge datasets are often viewed as a prerequisite for successful DL\napplications, techniques such as transfer learning, multi-ﬁdelity\nmodelling, and active learning can often make DL feasible for\nsmall datasets as well33–36.\nTraditionally, materials have been designed experimentally\nusing trial and error methods with a strong dose of chemical\nintuition. In addition to being a very costly and time-consuming\napproach, the number of material combinations is so huge that it\nis intractable to study experimentally, leading to the need for\nempirical formulation and computational methods. While compu-\ntational approaches (such as density functional theory, molecular\ndynamics, Monte Carlo, phase-ﬁeld, ﬁnite elements) are much\nfaster and cheaper than experiments, they are still limited by\nlength and time scale constraints, which in turn limits their\nrespective domains of applicability. DL methods can offer\nsubstantial\nspeedups\ncompared\nto\nconventional\nscientiﬁc\n1Materials Science and Engineering Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA. 2Theiss Research, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.\n3DeepMaterials LLC, Silver Spring, MD 20906, USA. 4Material Measurement Science Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.\n5Department of NanoEngineering, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA. 6Energy Technologies Area, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA,\nUSA. 7Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. 8Department of Materials Science and Engineering,\nNorthwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA. 9Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA. 10Department of\nApplied Physics and Applied Mathematics and the Data Science Institute, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027,\nUSA. ✉email: kamal.choudhary@nist.gov\nwww.nature.com/npjcompumats\nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\n1234567890():,;\ncomputing, and, for some applications, are reaching an accuracy\nlevel comparable to physics-based or computational models.\nMoreover, entering a new domain of materials science and\nperforming cutting-edge research requires years of education,\ntraining, and the development of specialized skills and intuition.\nFortunately, we now live in an era of increasingly open data and\ncomputational resources. Mature, well-documented DL libraries\nmake DL research much more easily accessible to newcomers\nthan almost any other research ﬁeld. Testing and benchmarking\nmethodologies\nsuch\nas\nunderﬁtting/overﬁtting/cross-valida-\ntion15,16,37 are common knowledge, and standards for measuring\nmodel performance are well established in the community.\nDespite their many advantages, DL methods have disadvan-\ntages too, the most signiﬁcant one being their black-box nature38\nwhich may hinder physical insights into the phenomena under\nexamination. Evaluating and increasing the interpretability and\nexplainability of DL models remains an active ﬁeld of research.\nGenerally a DL model has a few thousand to millions of\nparameters, making model interpretation and direct generation\nof scientiﬁc insight difﬁcult.\nAlthough there are several good recent reviews of ML\napplications in MSE15–17,19,39–49, DL for materials has been\nadvancing rapidly, warranting a dedicated review to cover the\nexplosion of research in this ﬁeld. This article discusses some of\nthe basic principles in DL methods and highlights major trends\namong the recent advances in DL applications for materials\nscience. As the tools and datasets for DL applications in materials\nkeep evolving, we provide a github repository (https://github.\ncom/deepmaterials/dlmatreview) that can be updated as new\nresources are made publicly available.\nGENERAL MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to give a detailed hands-on\nintroduction to Deep Learning. There are many materials for\nthis purpose, for example, the free online book “Neural\nNetworks and Deep Learning” by Michael Nielsen (http://\nneuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), Deep Learning by Good-\nfellow et al.21, and multiple online courses at Coursera, Udemy,\nand so on. Rather, this article aims to motivate materials\nscientist researchers in the types of problems that are amenable\nto DL, and to introduce some of the basic concepts, jargon, and\nmaterials-speciﬁc databases and software (at the time of\nwriting) as a helpful on-ramp to help get started. With this in\nmind, we begin with a very basic introduction to Deep learning.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI)13 is the development of machines and\nalgorithms that mimic human intelligence, for example, by\noptimizing actions to achieve certain goals. Machine learning\n(ML) is a subset of AI, and provides the ability to learn without\nexplicitly being programmed for a given dataset such as playing\nchess, social network recommendation etc. DL, in turn, is the\nsubset of ML that takes inspiration from biological brains and uses\nmultilayer neural networks to solve ML tasks. A schematic of AI-\nML-DL context and some of the key application areas of DL in the\nmaterials science and engineering ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 1.\nSome of the commonly used ML technologies are linear\nregression, decision trees, and random forest in which generalized\nmodels are trained to learn coefﬁcients/weights/parameters for a\ngiven dataset (usually structured i.e., on a grid or a spreadsheet).\nApplying traditional ML techniques to unstructured data (such\nas pixels or features from an image, sounds, text, and graphs) is\nchallenging because users have to ﬁrst extract generalized\nmeaningful representations or features themselves (such as\ncalculating pair-distribution for an atomic structure) and then\ntrain the ML models. Hence, the process becomes time-consum-\ning, brittle, and not easily scalable. Here, deep learning (DL)\ntechniques become more important.\nDL methods are based on artiﬁcial neural networks and\nallied techniques. According to the “universal approximation\ntheorem”50,51, neural networks can approximate any function\nto arbitrary accuracy. However, it is important to note that\nthe theorem doesn’t guarantee that the functions can be\nlearnt easily52.\nNEURAL NETWORKS\nPerceptron\nA perceptron or a single artiﬁcial neuron53 is the building block of\nartiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) and performs forward propaga-\ntion of information. For a set of inputs [x1, x2, . . . , xm] to the\nperceptron, we assign ﬂoating number weights (and biases to shift\nwights) [w1, w2, . . . , wm] and then we multiply them correspond-\ningly together to get a sum of all of them. Some of the common\nsoftware packages allowing NN trainings are: PyTorch54, Tensor-\nﬂow55, and MXNet56. Please note that certain commercial\nequipment, instruments, or materials are identiﬁed in this paper\nin order to specify the experimental procedure adequately. Such\nidentiﬁcation is not intended to imply recommendation or\nendorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the\nFig. 1\nSchematic showing an overview of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) methods and its\napplications in materials science and engineering. Deep learning is considered a part of machine learning, which is contained in an umbrella\nterm artiﬁcial intelligence.\nK. Choudhary et al.\n2\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\n1234567890():,;\nmaterials or equipment identiﬁed are necessarily the best\navailable for the purpose.\nActivation function\nActivation functions (such as sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh),\nrectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU), leaky ReLU, Swish) are the critical\nnonlinear components that enable neural networks to compose\nmany small building blocks to learn complex nonlinear functions.\nFor example, the sigmoid activation maps real numbers to the\nrange (0, 1); this activation function is often used in the last layer\nof binary classiﬁers to model probabilities. The choice of activation\nfunction can affect training efﬁciency as well as ﬁnal accuracy57.\nLoss function, gradient descent, and normalization\nThe weight matrices of a neural network are initialized randomly\nor obtained from a pre-trained model. These weight matrices are\nmultiplied with the input matrix (or output from a previous layer)\nand subjected to a nonlinear activation function to yield updated\nrepresentations, which are often referred to as activations or\nfeature maps. The loss function (also known as an objective\nfunction or empirical risk) is calculated by comparing the output of\nthe neural network and the known target value data. Typically,\nnetwork weights are iteratively updated via stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithms to minimize the loss function until the desired\naccuracy is achieved. Most modern deep learning frameworks\nfacilitate this by using reverse-mode automatic differentiation58 to\nobtain the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to\neach network parameter through recursive application of the\nchain rule. Colloquially, this is also known as back-propagation.\nCommon\ngradient\ndescent\nalgorithms\ninclude:\nStochastic\nGradient Descent (SGD), Adam, Adagrad etc. The learning rate is\nan important parameter in gradient descent. Except for SGD, all\nother methods use adaptive learning parameter tuning. Depend-\ning on the objective such as classiﬁcation or regression, different\nloss functions such as Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), Negative Log\nlikelihood (NLLL) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used.\nThe inputs of a neural network are generally scaled i.e.,\nnormalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.\nScaling is also applied to the input of hidden layers (using batch or\nlayer normalization) to improve the stability of ANNs.\nEpoch and mini-batches\nA single pass of the entire training data is called an epoch, and\nmultiple epochs are performed until the weights converge. In DL,\ndatasets are usually large and computing gradients for the entire\ndataset and network becomes challenging. Hence, the forward\npasses are done with small subsets of the training data called\nmini-batches.\nUnderﬁtting, overﬁtting, regularization, and early stopping\nDuring an ML training, the dataset is split into training,\nvalidation, and test sets. The test set is never used during the\ntraining process. A model is said to be underﬁtting if the model\nperforms poorly on the training set and lacks the capacity to\nfully learn the training data. A model is said to overﬁt if the\nmodel performs too well on the training data but does not\nperform well on the validation data. Overﬁtting is controlled\nwith\nregularization\ntechniques\nsuch\nas\nL2\nregularization,\ndropout, and early stopping37.\nRegularization discourages the model from simply memorizing\nthe training data, resulting in a model that is more generalizable.\nOverﬁtting models are often characterized by neurons that have\nweights with large magnitudes. L2 regularization reduces the\npossibility of overﬁtting by adding an additional term to the loss\nfunction that penalizes the large weight values, keeping the values\nof the weights and biases small during training. Another popular\nregularization is dropout59 in which we randomly set the\nactivations for an NN layer to zero during training. Similar to\nbagging60, the use of dropout brings about the same effect of\ntraining a collection of randomly chosen models which prevents\nthe co-adaptations among the neurons, consequently reducing\nthe likelihood of the model from overﬁtting. In early stopping,\nfurther epochs for training are stopped before the model overﬁts\ni.e., accuracy on the validation set ﬂattens or decreases.\nCONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN)61 can be viewed as a\nregularized version of multilayer perceptrons with a strong\ninductive bias for learning translation-invariant image representa-\ntions. There are four main components in CNNs: (a) learnable\nconvolution ﬁlterbanks, (b) nonlinear activations, (c) spatial\ncoarsening (via pooling or strided convolution), (d) a prediction\nmodule, often consisting of fully connected layers that operate on\na global instance representation.\nIn CNNs we use convolution functions with multiple kernels or\nﬁlters with trainable and shared weights or parameters, instead of\ngeneral matrix multiplication. These ﬁlters/kernels are matrices\nwith a relatively small number of rows and columns that convolve\nover the input to automatically extract high-level local features in\nthe form of feature maps. The ﬁlters slide/convolve (element-wise\nmultiply) across the input with a ﬁxed number of strides to\nproduce the feature map and the information thus learnt is passed\nto the hidden/fully connected layers. Depending on the input\ndata, these ﬁlters can be one, two, or three-dimensional.\nSimilar to the fully connected NNs, nonlinearities such as ReLU\nare then applied that allows us to deal with nonlinear and\ncomplicated\ndata.\nThe\npooling\noperation\npreserves\nspatial\ninvariance, downsamples and reduces the dimension of each\nfeature map obtained after convolution. These downsampling/\npooling operations can be of different types such as maximum-\npooling, minimum-pooling, average pooling, and sum pooling.\nAfter one or more convolutional and pooling layers, the outputs\nare usually reduced to a one-dimensional global representation.\nCNNs are especially popular for image data.\nGRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS\nGraphs and their variants\nClassical CNNs as described above are based on a regular grid\nEuclidean data (such as 2D grid in images). However, real-life data\nstructures, such as social networks, segments of images, word\nvectors, recommender systems, and atomic/molecular structures,\nare usually non-Euclidean. In such cases, graph-based non-\nEuclidean data structures become especially important.\nMathematically, a graph G is deﬁned as a set of nodes/vertices\nV, a set of edges/links, E and node features, X: G = (V, E, X)62–64 and\ncan be used to represent non-Euclidean data. An edge is formed\nbetween a pair of two nodes and contains the relation information\nbetween the nodes. Each node and edge can have attributes/\nfeatures associated with it. An adjacency matrix A is a square\nmatrix indicating connections between the nodes or not in the\nform of 1 (connected) and 0 (unconnected). A graph can be of\nvarious types such as: undirected/directed, weighted/unweighted,\nhomogeneous/heterogeneous, static/dynamic.\nAn undirected graph captures symmetric relations between\nnodes, while a directed one captures asymmetric relations such\nthat Aij ≠Aji. In a weighted graph, each edge is associated with a\nscalar weight rather than just 1s and 0s. In a homogeneous graph,\nall the nodes represent instances of the same type, and all the\nedges capture relations of the same type while in a hetero-\ngeneous graph, the nodes and edges can be of different types.\nHeterogeneous graphs provide an easy interface for managing\nK. Choudhary et al.\n3\nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nnodes and edges of different types as well as their associated\nfeatures. When input features or graph topology vary with time,\nthey are called dynamic graphs otherwise they are considered\nstatic. If a node is connected to another node more than once it is\ntermed a multi-graph.\nTypes of GNNs\nAt present, GNNs are probably the most popular AI method for\npredicting\nvarious\nmaterials\nproperties\nbased\non\nstructural\ninformation33,65–69. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are DL methods\nthat operate on graph domain and can capture the dependence\nof graphs via message passing between the nodes and edges of\ngraphs. There are two key steps in GNN training: (a) we ﬁrst\naggregate information from neighbors and (b) update the nodes\nand/or edges. Importantly, aggregation is permutation invariant.\nSimilar to the fully connected NNs, the input node features, X\n(with embedding matrix) are multiplied with the adjacency matrix\nand the weight matrices and then multiplied with the nonlinear\nactivation function to provide outputs for the next layer. This\nmethod is called the propagation rule.\nBased on the propagation rule and aggregation methodology,\nthere could be different variants of GNNs such as Graph\nconvolutional network (GCN)70, Graph attention network (GAT)71,\nRelational-GCN72, graph recurrent network (GRN)73, Graph isomer-\nism network (GIN)74, and Line graph neural network (LGNN)75.\nGraph convolutional neural networks are the most popular GNNs.\nSEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE MODELS\nTraditionally, learning from sequential inputs such as text involves\ngenerating a ﬁxed-length input from the data. For example, the\n“bag-of-words” approach simply counts the number of instances\nof each word in a document and produces a ﬁxed-length vector\nthat is the size of the overall vocabulary.\nIn contrast, sequence-to-sequence models can take into\naccount sequential/contextual information about each word\nand produce outputs of arbitrary length. For example, in named\nentity recognition (NER), an input sequence of words (e.g., a\nchemical abstract) is mapped to an output sequence of “entities”\nor categories where every word in the sequence is assigned a\ncategory.\nAn early form of sequence-to-sequence model is the recurrent\nneural network, or RNN. Unlike the fully connected NN architec-\nture, where there is no connection between hidden nodes in the\nsame layer, but only between nodes in adjacent layers, RNN has\nfeedback connections. Each hidden layer can be unfolded and\nprocessed similarly to traditional NNs sharing the same weight\nmatrices. There are multiple types of RNNs, of which the most\ncommon ones are: gated recurrent unit recurrent neural network\n(GRURNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and clock-\nwork RNN (CW-RNN)76.\nHowever, all such RNNs suffer from some drawbacks, includ-\ning: (i) difﬁculty of parallelization and therefore difﬁculty in\ntraining on large datasets and (ii) difﬁculty in preserving long-\nrange contextual information due to the “vanishing gradient”\nproblem. Nevertheless, as we will later describe, LSTMs have\nbeen successfully applied to various NER problems in the\nmaterials domain.\nMore recently, sequence-to-sequence models based on a\n“transformer” architecture, such as Google’s Bidirectional Enco-\nder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model77, have\nhelped address some of the issues of traditional RNNs. Rather\nthan passing a state vector that is iterated word-by-word, such\nmodels use an attention mechanism to allow access to all\nprevious words simultaneously without explicit time steps. This\nmechanism facilitates parallelization and also better preserves\nlong-term context.\nGENERATIVE MODELS\nWhile the above DL frameworks are based on supervised machine\nlearning (i.e., we know the target or ground truth data such as in\nclassiﬁcation\nand\nregression)\nand\ndiscriminative\n(i.e.,\nlearn\ndifferentiating features between various datasets), many AI tasks\nare based on unsupervised (such as clustering) and are generative\n(i.e., aim to learn underlying distributions)78.\nGenerative models are used to (a) generate data samples similar\nto the training set with variations i.e., augmentation and for\nsynthetic data, (b) learn good generalized latent features, (c) guide\nmixed reality applications such as virtual try-on. There are various\ntypes of generative models, of which the most common are: (a)\nvariational encoders (VAE), which explicitly deﬁne and learn\nlikelihood of data, (b) Generative adversarial networks (GAN),\nwhich learn to directly generate samples from model’s distribu-\ntion, without deﬁning any density function.\nA VAE model has two components: namely encoder and\ndecoder. A VAE’s encoder takes input from a target distribution\nand compresses it into a low-dimensional latent space. Then the\ndecoder takes that latent space representation and reproduces\nthe original image. Once the network is trained, we can generate\nlatent space representations of various images, and interpolate\nbetween these before forwarding them through the decoder\nwhich produces new images. A VAE is similar to a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) but instead of linear data assumption in\nPCA, VAEs work in nonlinear domain. A GAN model also has two\ncomponents: namely generator, and discriminator. GAN’s gen-\nerator generates fake/synthetic data that could fool the discrimi-\nnator. Its discriminator tries to distinguish fake data from real ones.\nThis process is also termed as “min-max two-player game.” We\nnote that VAE models learn the hidden state distributions during\nthe training process, while GAN’s hidden state distributions are\npredeﬁned. Rather GAN generators serve to generate images that\ncould fool the discriminator. These techniques are widely used for\nimages and spectra and have also been recently applied to atomic\nstructures.\nDEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\nReinforcement learning (RL) deals with tasks in which a\ncomputational agent learns to make decisions by trial and error.\nDeep RL uses DL into the RL framework, allowing agents to make\ndecisions from unstructured input data79. In traditional RL,\nMarkov decision process (MDP) is used in which an agent at\nevery timestep takes action to receive a scalar reward and\ntransitions to the next state according to system dynamics to\nlearn policy in order to maximize returns. However, in deep RL,\nthe states are high-dimensional (such as continuous images or\nspectra) which act as an input to DL methods. DRL architectures\ncan be either model-based or model-free.\nSCIENTIFIC MACHINE LEARNING\nThe nascent ﬁeld of scientiﬁc machine learning (SciML)80 is\ncreating new opportunities across all paradigms of machine\nlearning, and deep learning in particular. SciML is focused on\ncreating ML systems that incorporate scientiﬁc knowledge and\nphysical principles, either directly in the speciﬁc form of the model\nor indirectly through the optimization algorithms used for\ntraining. This offers potential improvements in sample and\ntraining complexity, robustness (particularly under extrapolation),\nand model interpretability. One prominent theme can be found in\nref. 57. Such implementations usually involve applying multiple\nphysics-based constraints while training a DL model81–83. One of\nthe key challenges of universal function approximation is that a\nNN can quickly learn spurious features that have nothing to do\nwith the features that a researcher could be actually interested in,\nK. Choudhary et al.\n4\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nwithin the data. In this sense, physics-based regularization can\nassist. Physics-based deep learning can also aid in inverse design\nproblems, a challenging but important task84,85. On the ﬂip side,\ndeep Learning using Graph Neural Nets and symbolic regression\n(stochastically building symbolic expressions) has even been used\nto “discover” symbolic equations from data that capture known\n(and unknown) physics behind the data86, i.e., to deep learn a\nphysics model rather than to use a physics model to constrain DL.\nOVERVIEW OF APPLICATIONS\nSome aspects of successful DL application that require materials-\nscience-speciﬁc considerations are:\n(1)\nacquiring large, balanced, and diverse datasets (often on the\norder of 10,000 data points or more),\n(2)\ndeterming an appropriate DL approach and suitable vector\nor graph representation of the input samples, and\n(3)\nselecting appropriate performance metrics relevant to\nscientiﬁc goals.\nIn the following sections we discuss some of the key areas of\nmaterials science in which DL has been applied with available links\nto repositories and datasets that help in the reproducibility and\nextensibility of the work. In this review we categorize materials\nscience applications at a high level by the type of input data\nconsidered: 11 atomistic, 12 stoichiometric, 13 spectral, 14 image,\nand 15 text. We summarize prevailing machine learning tasks and\ntheir impact on materials research and development within each\nbroad materials data modality.\nAPPLICATIONS IN ATOMISTIC REPRESENTATIONS\nIn this section, we provide a few examples of solving materials\nscience problems with DL methods trained on atomistic data. The\natomic structure of material usually consists of atomic coordinates\nand atomic composition information of material. An arbitrary\nnumber of atoms and types of elements in a system poses a\nchallenge to apply traditional ML algorithms for atomistic\npredictions. DL-based methods are an obvious strategy to tackle\nthis problem. There have been several previous attempts to\nrepresent crystals and molecules using ﬁxed-size descriptors such\nas Coulomb matrix87–89, classical force ﬁeld inspired descriptors\n(CFID)90–92, pair-distribution function (PRDF), Voronoi tessella-\ntion93–95. Recently graph neural network methods have been\nshown to surpass previous hand-crafted feature set28.\nDL for atomistic materials applications include: (a) force-ﬁeld\ndevelopment, (b) direct property predictions, (c) materials screen-\ning. In addition to the above points, we also elucidate upon some\nof the recent generative adversarial network and complimentary\nmethods to atomistic aproaches.\nDatabases and software libraries\nIn Table 1 we provide some of the commonly used datasets used\nfor atomistic DL models for molecules, solids, and proteins. We\nnote that the computational methods used for different datasets\nare different and many of them are continuously evolving.\nGenerally it takes years to generate such databases using\nconventional methods such as density functional theory; in\ncontrast, DL methods can be used to make predictions with\nmuch reduced computational cost and reasonable accuracy.\nTable 1 we provide DL software packages used for atomistic\nmaterials design. The type of models includes general property\n(GP) predictors and interatomic force ﬁelds (FF). The models have\nbeen demonstrated in molecules (Mol), solid-state materials (Sol),\nor proteins (Prot). For some force ﬁelds, high-performance large-\nscale implementations (LSI) that leverage paralleling computing\nexist. Some of these methods mainly used interatomic distances\nto build graphs while others use distances as well as bond-angle\ninformation. Recently, including bond angle within GNN has been\nshown to drastically improve the performance with comparable\ncomputational timings.\nForce-ﬁeld development\nThe ﬁrst application includes the development of DL-based force\nﬁelds (FF)96,97/interatomic potentials. Some of the major advan-\ntages of such applications are that they are very fast (on the order\nof hundreds to thousands times64) for making predictions and\nsolving the tenuous development of FFs, but the disadvantage is\nthey still require a large dataset using computationally expensive\nmethods to train.\nModels such as Behler-Parrinello neural network (BPNN) and its\nvariants98,99 are used for developing interatomic potentials that\ncan be used beyond just 0 K temperature and time-dependent\nbehavior using molecular dynamics simulations such as for\nnanoparticles100. Such FF models have been developed for\nmolecular systems, such as water, methane, and other organic\nmolecules99,101 as well as solids such as silicon98, sodium102,\ngraphite103, and titania (TiO2)104.\nWhile the above works are mainly based on NNs, there has also\nbeen the development of graph neural network force-ﬁeld\n(GNNFF) framework105,106 that bypasses both computational\nbottlenecks. GNNFF can predict atomic forces directly using\nautomatically extracted structural features that are not only\ntranslationally invariant, but rotationally-covariant to the coordi-\nnate space of the atomic positions, i.e., the features and hence the\npredicted force vectors rotate the same way as the rotation of\ncoordinates. In addition to the development of pure NN-based\nFFs, there have also been recent developments of combining\ntraditional FFs such as bond-order potentials with NNs and ReaxFF\nwith message passing neural network (MPNN) that can help\nmitigate the NNs issue for extrapolation82,107.\nDirect property prediction from atomistic conﬁgurations\nDL methods can be used to establish a structure-property\nrelationship between atomic structure and their properties with\nhigh\naccuracy28,108.\nModels\nsuch\nas\nSchNet,\ncrystal\ngraph\nconvolutional neural network (CGCNN), improved crystal graph\nconvolutional neural network (iCGCNN), directional message\npassing neural network (DimeNet), atomistic line graph neural\nnetwork (ALIGNN) and materials graph neural network (MEGNet)\nshown in Table 1 have been used to predict up to 50 properties of\ncrystalline and molecular materials. These property datasets are\nusually obtained from ab-initio calculations. A schematic of such\nmodels shown in Fig. 2. While SchNet, CGCNN, MEGNet are\nprimarily based on atomic distances, iCGCNN, DimeNet, and\nALIGNN models capture many-body interactions using GCNN.\nSome of these properties include formation energies, electronic\nbandgaps, solar-cell efﬁciency, topological spin-orbit spillage,\ndielectric constants, piezoelectric constants, 2D exfoliation ener-\ngies, electric ﬁeld gradients, elastic modulus, Seebeck coefﬁcients,\npower factors, carrier effective masses, highest occupied mole-\ncular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, energy gap,\nzero-point vibrational energy, dipole moment, isotropic polariz-\nability, electronic spatial extent, internal energy.\nFor instance, the current state-of-the-art mean absolute error for\nformation energy for solids at 0 K is 0.022 eV/atom as obtained by\nthe ALIGNN model65. DL is also heavily being used for predicting\ncatalytic behavior of materials such as the Open Catalyst Project109\nwhich is driven by the DL methods materials design. There is an\nongoing effort to continuously improve the models. Usually\nenergy-based models such as formation and total energies are\nmore accurate than electronic property-based models such as\nbandgaps and power factors.\nK.

Choudhary et al.\n6\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nIn addition to molecules and solids, property predictions\nmodels have also been used for bio-materials such as proteins,\nwhich can be viewed as large molecules. There have been several\nefforts for predicting protein-based properties, such as binding\nafﬁnity66 and docking predictions110.\nThere have also been several applications for identifying\nreasonable chemical space using DL methods such as autoenco-\nders111 and reinforcement learning112–114 for inverse materials\ndesign. Inverse materials design with techniques such as GAN\ndeals with ﬁnding chemical compounds with suitable properties\nand act as complementary to forward prediction models. While\nsuch concepts have been widely applied to molecular systems,115,\nrecently these methods have been applied to solids as well116–120.\nFast materials screening\nDFT-based high-throughput methods are usually limited to a few\nthousands of compounds and take a long time for calculations,\nDL-based methods can aid this process and allow much faster\npredictions. DL-based property prediction models mentioned\nabove can be used for pre-screening chemical compounds.\nHence, DL-based tools can be viewed as a pre-screening tool for\ntraditional methods such as DFT. For example, Xie et al. used\nCGCNN model to screen stable perovskite materials67 as well\nhierarchical visualization of materials space121. Park et al.122 used\niCGCNN to screen ThCr2Si2-type materials. Lugier et al. used DL\nmethods to predict thermoelectric properties123. Rosen et al.124\nused graph neural network models to predict the bandgaps of\nmetal-organic frameworks. DL for molecular materials has been\nused to predict technologically important properties such as\naqueous solubility125 and toxicity126.\nIt should be noted that the full atomistic representations and\nthe associated DL models are only possible if the crystal structure\nand atom positions are available. In practice, the precise atom\npositions are only available from DFT structural relaxations or\nexperiments, and are one of the goals for materials discovery\ninstead of the starting point. Hence, alternative methods have\nbeen proposed to bypass the necessity for atom positions in\nbuilding DL models. For example, Jain and Bligaard127 proposed\nthe atomic position-independent descriptors and used a CNN\nmodel to learn the energies of crystals. Such descriptors include\ninformation based only on the symmetry (e.g., space group and\nWyckoff position). In principle, the method can be applied\nuniversally in all crystals. Nevertheless, the model errors tend to\nbe much higher than graph-based models. Similar coarse-grained\nrepresentation using Wyckoff representation was also used by\nGoodall et al.128. Alternatively, Zuo et al.129 started from the\nhypothetical structures without precise atom positions, and used a\nBayesian optimization method coupled with a MEGNet energy\nmodel as an energy evaluator to perform direct structural\nrelaxation. Applying the Bayesian optimization with symmetry\nrelaxation\n(BOWSR) algorithm\nsuccessfully discovered\nReWB\n(Pca21) and MoWC2 (P63/mmc) hard materials, which were then\nexperimentally synthesized.\nAPPLICATIONS IN CHEMICAL FORMULA AND SEGMENT\nREPRESENTATIONS\nOne of the earliest applications for DL included SMILES for\nmolecules, elemental fractions and chemical descriptors for solids,\nand sequence of protein names as descriptors.

SMILES can express structural differ-\nences including the chirality of compounds, making it more useful\nthan a simply chemical formula. A SMILES string is a simple grid-\nlike (1-D grid) structure that can represent molecular sequences\nsuch\nas\nDNA,\nmacromolecules/polymers,\nprotein\nsequences\nalso130,131. In addition to the chemical constituents as in the\nchemical formula, bondings (such as double and triple bondings)\nare represented by special symbols (such as ’=’ and ’#’). The\npresence of a branch point indicated using a left-hand bracket “(”\nwhile the right-hand bracket “)” indicates that all the atoms in that\nbranch have been taken into account. SMILES strings are\nrepresented as a distributed representation termed a SMILES\nfeature matrix (as a sparse matrix), and then we can apply DL to\nthe matrix similar to image data. The length of the SMILES matrix\nis generally kept ﬁxed (such as 400) during training and in\naddition to the SMILES multiple elemental attributes and bonding\nattributes (such as chirality, aromaticity) can be used. Key DL tasks\nfor molecules include (a) novel molecule design, (b) molecule\nscreening.\nNovel molecules with target properties can designed using VAE,\nGAN\nand\nRNN\nbased\nmethods132–134.\nThese\nDL-generated\nmolecules might not be physically valid, but the goal is to train\nthe model to learn the patterns in SMILES strings such that the\noutput resembles valid molecules. Then chemical intuitions can be\nfurther used to screen the molecules. DL for SMILES can also be\nused for molecularscreening such as to predict molecular toxicity.\nSome of the common SMILES datasets are: ZINC135, Tox21136, and\nPubChem137.\nDue to the limitations to enforce the generation of valid\nmolecular structures from SMILES, fragment-based models are\ndeveloped such as DeepFrag and DeepFrag-K138,139. In fragment-\nbased models, a ligand/receptor complex is removed and then a\nDL model is trained to predict the most suitable fragment\nsubstituent. A set of useful tools for SMILES and fragment\nrepresentations are provided in Table 2.\nChemical formula representation\nThere are several ways of using the chemical formula-based\nrepresentations for building ML/DL models, beginning with a\nsimple vector of raw elemental fractions140,141 or of weight\npercentages of alloying compositions142–145, as well as more\nsophisticated hand-crafted descriptors or physical attributes to\nadd known chemistry knowledge (e.g., electronegativity, valency,\netc. of constituent elements) to the feature representations146–151.\nStatistical and mathematical operations such as average, max, min,\nmedian, mode, and exponentiation can be carried out on\nelemental properties of the constituent elements to get a set of\ndescriptors\nfor\na\ngiven\ncompound.\nThe\nnumber\nof\nsuch\ncomposition-based features can range from a few dozens to a\nfew hundreds. One of the commonly used representations that\nhave been shown to work for a variety of different use-cases is the\nmaterials agnostic platform for informatics and exploration\n(MagPie)150. All these composition-based representations can be\nused with both traditional ML methods such as Random Forest as\nwell as DL.\nIt is relevant to note that ElemNet141, which is a 17-layer neural\nnetwork composed of fully connected layers and uses only raw\nelemental fractions as input, was found to signiﬁcantly outperform\ntraditional ML methods such as Random Forest, even when they\nwere allowed to use more sophisticated physical attributes based\non MagPie as input. Although no periodic table information was\nprovided to the model, it was found to self-learn some interesting\nchemistry, like groups (element similarity) and charge balance\n(element interaction). It was also able to predict phase diagrams\non unseen materials systems, underscoring the power of DL for\nrepresentation learning directly from raw inputs without explicit\nfeature extraction. Further increasing the depth of the network\nwas found to adversely affect the model accuracy due to the\nvanishing gradient problem. To address this issue, Jha et al.152\ndeveloped IRNet, which uses individual residual learning to allow a\nsmoother ﬂow of gradients and enable deeper learning for cases\nwhere big data is available. IRNet models were tested on a variety\nof big and small materials datasets, such as OQMD, AFLOW,\nMaterials Project, JARVIS, using different vector-based materials\nrepresentations (element fractions, MagPie, structural) and were\nfound to not only successfully alleviate the vanishing gradient\nproblem and enable deeper learning, but also lead to signiﬁcantly\nbetter model accuracy as compared to plain deep neural networks\nand traditional ML techniques for a given input materials\nrepresentation in the presence of big data153. Further, graph-\nbased methods such as Roost154 have also been developed which\ncan outperform many similar techniques.\nSuch methods have been used for diverse DFT datasets\nmentioned above in Table 1 as well as experimental datasets\nsuch as SuperCon155,156 for quick pre-screening applications. In\nterms of applications, they have been applied for predicting\nproperties such as formation energy141, bandgap, and magnetiza-\ntion152, superconducting temperatures156, bulk, and shear mod-\nulus153. They have also been used for transfer learning across\ndatasets for enhanced predictive accuracy on small data34, even\nfor different source and target properties157, which is especially\nuseful to build predictive models for target properties for which\nbig source datasets may not be readily available.\nTable 2.\nSoftware to apply DL to chemical formula, SMILES, and\nfragment representations.\nChemical formula\nModel name\nLink\nRef.\nMatMiner\nhttps://github.com/hackingmaterials/\nmatminer\n151\nMagPie\nhttps://bitbucket.org/wolverton/magpie\n150\nDScribe\nhttps://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe\n158\nElemNet\nhttps://github.com/NU-CUCIS/ElemNet\n141\nIRNet\nhttps://github.com/NU-CUCIS/IRNet\n152,153\nRoost\nhttps://github.com/CompRhys/roost\n154\nCrabNet\nhttps://github.com/anthony-wang/CrabNet\n333\nCFID-Chem\nhttps://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis/\n90\nAtom2vec\nhttps://github.com/idocx/Atom2Vec\n334\nCrossPropertyTL https://github.com/NU-CUCIS/\nCrossPropertyTL\n157\nSMILES and fragments\nDeepSMILES\nhttps://github.com/baoilleach/deepsmiles\n335\nChemicalVAE\nhttps://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/\nchemical_vae\n336\nCVAE\nhttps://github.com/jaechanglim/CVAE\n133\nDeepChem\nhttps://github.com/deepchem/deepchem\n332\nDeepFRAG\nhttps://git.durrantlab.pitt.edu/jdurrant/\ndeepfrag/\n337\nDeepFRAG-k\nhttps://github.com/yaohangli/DeepFragK/\n338\nCheMixNet\nhttps://github.com/NU-CUCIS/CheMixNet\n339\nSINet\nhttps://github.com/NU-CUCIS/SINet\n340\nK. Choudhary et al.\n8\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nThere have been libraries of such descriptors developed such as\nMatMiner151 and DScribe158. Some examples of such models are\ngiven in Table 2. Such representations are especially useful for\nexperimental datasets such as those for superconducting materi-\nals where the atomic structure is not tabulated. However, these\nrepresentations cannot distinguish different polymorphs of a\nsystem with different point groups and space groups. It has been\nrecently shown that although composition-based representations\ncan help build ML/DL models to predict some properties like\nformation energy with remarkable accuracy, it does not necessa-\nrily translate to accurate predictions of other properties such as\nstability, when compared to DFT’s own accuracy159.\nSPECTRAL MODELS\nWhen electromagnetic radiation hits materials, the interaction\nbetween the radiation and matter measured as a function of the\nwavelength or frequency of the radiation produces a spectro-\nscopic signal. By studying spectroscopy, researchers can gain\ninsights into the materials’ composition, structural, and dynamic\nproperties. Spectroscopic techniques are foundational in materi-\nals characterization. For instance, X-ray diffraction (XRD) has\nbeen used to characterize the crystal structure of materials for\nmore than a century. Spectroscopic analysis can involve ﬁtting\nquantitative physical models (for example, Rietveld reﬁnement)\nor more empirical approaches such as ﬁtting linear combina-\ntions of reference spectra, such as with x-ray absorption near-\nedge spectroscopy (XANES). Both approaches require a high\ndegree of researcher expertise through careful design of\nexperiments; speciﬁcation, revision, and iterative ﬁtting of\nphysical models; or the availability of template spectra of known\nmaterials. In recent years, with the advances in high-throughput\nexperiments and computational data, spectroscopic data has\nmultiplied, giving opportunities for researchers to learn from the\ndata and potentially displace the conventional methods in\nanalyzing such data. This section covers emerging DL applica-\ntions in various modes of spectroscopic data analysis, aiming to\noffer practice examples and insights. Some of the applications\nare shown in Fig. 3.\nDatabases and software libraries\nCurrently, large-scale and element-diverse spectral data mainly\nexist in computational databases. For example, in ref. 160, the\nauthors calculated the infrared spectra, piezoelectric tensor, Born\neffective charge tensor, and dielectric response as a part of the\nJARVIS-DFT DFPT database. The Materials Project has established\nthe largest computational X-ray absorption database (XASDb),\nFig. 3\nExample applications of deep learning for spectral data. a Predicting structure information from the X-ray diffraction374, Reprinted\naccording to the terms of the CC-BY license374.

Choudhary et al.\n9\nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \ncovering the K-edge X-ray near-edge ﬁne structure (XANES)161,162\nand the L-edge XANES163 of a large number of material structures.\nThe database currently hosts more than 400,000 K-edge XANES\nsite-wise spectra and 90,000 L-edge XANES site-wise spectra of\nmany compounds in the Materials Project. There are considerably\nfewer experimental XAS spectra, being on the order of hundreds,\nas seen\nin the EELSDb\nand the\nXASLib.\nCollecting\nlarge\nexperimental spectra databases that cover a wide range of\nelements is a challenging task. Collective efforts focused on\ncurating data extracted from different sources, as found in the\nRRUFF Raman, XRD and chemistry database164, the open Raman\ndatabase165, and the SOP spectra library166. However, data\nconsistency is not guaranteed. It is also now possible for\ncontributors to share experimental data in a Materials Project\ncurated database, MPContribs167. This database is supported by\nthe US Department of Energy (DOE) providing some expectation\nof persistence. Entries can be kept private or published and are\nlinked to the main materials project computational databases.\nThere is an ongoing effort to capture data from DOE-funded\nsynchrotron light sources (https://lightsources.materialsproject.\norg/) into MPContribs in the future.\nRecent advances in sources, detectors, and experimental\ninstrumentation have made high-throughput measurements of\nexperimental spectra possible, giving rise to new possibilities for\nspectral data generation and modeling. Such examples include\nthe HTEM database10 that contains 50,000 optical absorption\nspectra and the UV-Vis database of 180,000 samples from the Joint\nCenter for Artiﬁcial Photosynthesis. Some of the common spectra\ndatabases for spectra data are shown in Table 3. There are\nbeginning to appear cloud-based software as a service platforms\nfor high-throughput data analysis, for example, pair-distribution\nfunction (PDF) in the cloud (https://pdﬁtc.org)168 which are backed\nby structured databases, where data can be kept private or made\npublic. This transition to the cloud from data analysis software\ninstalled and run locally on a user’s computer will facilitate the\nsharing and reuse of data by the community.\nApplications\nDue to the widespread deployment of XRD across many\nmaterials technologies, XRD spectra became one of the ﬁrst\ntest grounds for DL models. Phase identiﬁcation from XRD can\nbe mapped into a classiﬁcation task (assuming all phases are\nknown) or an unsupervised clustering task. Unlike the traditional\nanalysis of XRD data, where the spectra are treated as\nconvolved, discrete peak positions and intensities, DL methods\ntreat the data as a continuous pattern similar to an image.\nUnfortunately,\na\nsigniﬁcant\nnumber\nof\nexperimental\nXRD\ndatasets in one place are not readily available at the moment.\nNevertheless, extensive,\nhigh-quality\ncrystal\nstructure data\nmakes creating simulated XRD trivial.\nPark et al.169 calculated 150,000 XRD patterns from the\nInorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) structural database170\nand then used CNN models to predict structural information from\nthe simulated XRD patterns. The accuracies of the CNN models\nreached 81.14%, 83.83%, and 94.99% for space-group, extinction-\ngroup, and crystal-system classiﬁcations, respectively.\nLiu et al.95 obtained similar accuracies by using a CNN for\nclassifying atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) data into space\ngroups. The PDF is obtained by Fourier transforming XRD into real\nspace and is particularly useful for studying the local and\nnanoscale structure of materials. In the case of the PDF, models\nwere trained, validated, and tested on simulated data from the\nICSD. However, the trained model showed excellent performance\nwhen given experimental data, something that can be a challenge\nin XRD data because of the different resolutions and line-shapes of\nthe diffraction data depending on speciﬁcs of the sample and\nexperimental conditions. The PDF seems to be more robust\nagainst these aspects.\nSimilarly, Zaloga et al.171 also used the ICSD database for XRD\npattern generation and CNN models to classify crystals. The\nmodels achieved 90.02% and 79.82% accuracy for crystal systems\nand space groups, respectively.\nIt should be noted that the ICSD database contains many\nduplicates, and such duplicates should be ﬁltered out to avoid\ninformation leakage. There is also a large difference in the number\nof structures represented in each space group (the label) in the\ndatabase resulting in data normalization challenges.\nLee et al.172 developed a CNN model for phase identiﬁcation\nfrom samples consisting of a mixture of several phases in a limited\nchemical space relevant for battery materials. The training data are\nmixed patterns consisting of 1,785,405 synthetic XRD patterns from\nthe Sr-Li-Al-O phase space. The resulting CNN can not only identify\nthe phases but also predict the compound fraction in the mixture.\nTable 3.\nDatabases and software packages for applying DL methods\nfor spectra data.\nDatabases\nDB name\nDatasize Link\nRef.\nMP XAS-DB\n490k\nhttps://materialsproject.org/\n162,163\nJV Dielectric\nfunction\n16k\nhttp://jarvis.nist.gov/jarvisdft\n341\nJV Infrared\n5k\nhttp://jarvis.nist.gov/jarvisdft\n160\nRRUFF\n3527\nhttps://rruff.info\n164\nICDD XRD\n108k\nhttps://www.icdd.com/pdf-\nproduct-summary/\n342\nICSD XRD\n150k\nhttps://icsd.nist.gov/\n343\nCOD XRD\n480k\nhttp://www.crystallography.\nnet/cod/\n344\nMP XRD\n140k\nhttps://materialsproject.org/\n5\nJV XRD\n60k\nhttps://jarvis.nist.gov/jarvisdft/\n3\nMPContribs\n–\nhttps://mpcontribs.org/\n167\nRaman OpenDB\n1k\nhttps://solsa.crystallography.\nnet/rod/index.php\n165\nChem.

Choudhary et al.\n10\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nA similar CNN was utilized by Wang et al.173 for fast identiﬁcation\nof metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), where experimental spectral\nnoise was extracted and then synthesized into the theoretical XRD\nfor training data augmentation.\nAn alternative idea was proposed by Dong et al.174. Instead of\nrecognizing only phases from the CNN, a proposed “parameter\nquantiﬁcation network” (PQ-Net) was able to extract physico-\nchemical information. The PQ-Net yields accurate predictions for\nscale factors, crystallite size, and lattice parameters for simulated\nand experimental XRD spectra. The work by Aguiar et al.175 took a\nstep further and proposed a modular neural network architecture\nthat enables the combination of diffraction patterns and chemistry\ndata and provided a ranked list of predictions. The ranked list\npredictions provide user ﬂexibility and overcome some aspects of\noverconﬁdence in model predictions. In practical applications, AI-\ndriven XRD identiﬁcation can be beneﬁcial for high-throughput\nmaterials discovery, as shown by Maffettone et al.176. In their work,\nan ensemble of 50 CNN models was trained on synthetic data\nreproducing experimental variations (missing peaks, broadening,\npeaking shifting, noises). The model ensemble is capable of\npredicting the probability of each category label. A similar data\naugmentation idea was adopted by Oviedo et al.177, where\nexperimental XRD data for 115 thin-ﬁlm metal-halides were\nmeasured, and CNN models trained on the augmented XRD data\nachieved accuracies of 93% and 89% for classifying dimensionality\nand space group, respectively.\nAlthough not a DL method, an unsupervised machine learning\napproach, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), is showing\ngreat promise for yielding chemically relevant XRD spectra from\ntime- or spatially-dependent sets of diffraction patterns. NMF is\nclosely related to principle component analysis in that it takes a\nset of patterns as a matrix and then compresses the data by\nreducing the dimensionality by ﬁnding the most important\ncomponents. In NMF a constraint is applied that all the\ncomponents and their weights must be strictly positive. This\noften corresponds to a real physical situation (for example, spectra\ntend to be positive, as are the weights of chemical constituents).\nAs a result, it appears that the mathematical decomposition often\nresults in interpretable, physically meaningful, components and\nweights, as shown by Liu et al. for PDF data178. An extension of\nthis showed that in a spatially resolved study, NMF could be used\nto extract chemically resolved differential PDFs (similar to the\ninformation in EXAFS) from non-chemically resolved PDF mea-\nsurements179. NMF is very quick and easy to apply and can be\napplied to just about any set of spectra. It is likely to become\nwidely used and is being implemented in the PDFitc.org website\nto make it more accessible to potential users.\nOther than XRD, the XAS, Raman, and infrared spectra, also\ncontain rich structure-dependent spectroscopic information about\nthe material. Unlike XRD, where relatively simple theories and\nequations exist to relate structures to the spectral patterns, the\nrelationships between general spectra and structures are some-\nwhat elusive. This difﬁculty has created a higher demand for\nmachine learning models to learn structural information from\nother spectra.\nFor instance, the case of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS),\nincluding the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES)\nand extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS), is usually\nused to analyze the structural information on an atomic level.\nHowever, the high signal-to-noise XANES region has no equation\nfor data ﬁtting. DL modeling of XAS data is fascinating and offers\nunprecedented insights. Timoshenko et al. used neural networks\nto predict the coordination numbers of Pt180 and Cu181 in\nnanoclusters from the XANES. Aside from the high accuracies, the\nneural network also offers high prediction speed and new\nopportunities\nfor\nquantitative\nXANES\nanalysis.\nTimoshenko\net al.182 further carried out a novel analysis of EXAFS using DL.\nAlthough EXAFS analysis has an explicit equation to ﬁt, the study\nis limited to the ﬁrst few coordination shells and on relatively\nordered materials. Timoshenko et al.182 ﬁrst transformed the\nEXAFS data into 2D maps with a wavelet transform and then\nsupplied the 2D data to a neural network model. The model can\ninstantly predict relatively long-range radial distribution functions,\noffering in situ local structure analysis of materials. The advent of\nhigh-throughput XAS databases has recently unveiled more\npossibilities for machine learning models to be deployed using\nXAS data. For example, Zheng et al.161 used an ensemble learning\nmethod to match and fast search new spectra in the XASDb. Later,\nthe same authors showed that random forest models outperform\nDL models such as MLPs or CNNs in directly predicting atomic\nenvironment labels from the XANES spectra183. Similar approaches\nwere also adopted by Torrisi et al.184 In practical applications,\nAndrejevic et al.185 used the XASDb data together with the\ntopological materials database. They constructed CNN models to\nclassify the topology of materials from the XANES and symmetry\ngroup inputs. The model correctly predicted 81% topological and\n80% trivial cases and achieved 90% accuracy in material classes\ncontaining certain elements.\nRaman, infrared, and other vibrational spectroscopies provide\nstructural ﬁngerprints and are usually used to discriminate and\nestimate the concentration of components in a mixture. For\nexample, Madden et al.186 have used neural network models to\npredict the concentration of illicit materials in a mixture using the\nRaman spectra. Interestingly, several groups have independently\nfound that DL models outperform chemometrics analysis in\nvibrational spectroscopies187,188. For learning vibrational spectra,\nthe number of training spectra is usually less than or on the order\nof the number of features (intensity points), and the models can\neasily\noverﬁt.\nHence,\ndimensional\nreduction\nstrategies\nare\ncommonly used to compress the information dimension using,\nfor\nexample,\nprincipal\ncomponent\nanalysis\n(PCA)189,190.\nDL\napproaches do not have such concerns and offer elegant and\nuniﬁed solutions. For example, Liu et al.191 applied CNN models to\nthe Raman spectra in the RRUFF spectral database and show that\nCNN models outperform classical machine learning models such\nas SVM in classiﬁcation tasks. More DL applications in vibrational\nspectral analysis can be found in a recent review by Yang et al.192.\nAlthough most current DL work focuses on the inverse problem,\ni.e., predicting structural information from the spectra, some\ninnovative approaches also solve the forward problems by\npredicting the spectra from the structure. In this case, the\nspectroscopy data can be viewed simply as a high-dimensional\nmaterial property of the structure. This is most common in\nmolecular science, where predicting the infrared spectra193,\nmolecular excitation spectra194, is of particular interest. In the\nearly 2000s, Selzer et al.193 and Kostka et al.195 attempted\npredicting the infrared spectra directly from the molecular\nstructural descriptors using neural networks. Non-DL models can\nalso perform such tasks to a reasonable accuracy196. For DL\nmodels, Chen et al.197 used a Euclidean neural network (E(3)NN) to\npredict the phonon density of state (DOS) spectra198 from atom\npositions\nand\nelement\ntypes.\nThe\nE(3)NN\nmodel\ncaptures\nsymmetries of the crystal structures, with no need to perform\ndata augmentation to achieve target invariances. Hence the E(3)\nNN model is extremely data-efﬁcient and can give reliable DOS\nspectra prediction and heat capacity using relatively sparse data of\n1200 calculation results on 65 elements. A similar idea was also\nused to predict the XAS spectra. Carbone et al.199 used a message\npassing neural network (MPNN) to predict the O and N K-edge\nXANES spectra from the molecular structures in the QM9\ndatabase7. The training XANES data were generated using the\nFEFF package200. The trained MPNN model reproduced all\nprominent peaks in the predicted XANES, and 90% of the\npredicted peaks are within 1 eV of the FEFF calculations. Similarly,\nRankine et al.201 started from the two-body radial distribution\nK. Choudhary et al.\n11\nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nfunction (RDC) and used a deep neural network model to predict\nthe Fe K-edge XANES spectra for arbitrary local environments.\nIn addition to learn the structure-spectra or spectra-structure\nrelationships, a few works have also explored the possibility of\nrelating spectra to other material properties in a non-trivial way.\nThe DOSnet proposed by Fung et al.202 (Fig. 3b) uses the\nelectronic DOS spectra calculated from DFT as inputs to a CNN\nmodel to predict the adsorption energies of H, C, N, O, S and their\nhydrogenated counterparts, CH, CH2, CH3, NH, OH, and SH, on\nbimetallic alloy surfaces. This approach extends the previous\nd-band theory203, where only the d-band center, a scalar, was\nused to correlate with the adsorption energy on transition metals.\nSimilarly, Kaundinya et al.204 used Atomistic Line Graph Neural\nNetwork (ALIGNN) to predict DOS for 56,000 materials in the\nJARVIS-DFT database using a direct discretized spectrum (D-\nALIGNN), and a compressed low-dimensional representation using\nan autoencoder (AE-ALIGNN). Stein et al.205 tried to learn the\nmapping between the image and the UV-vis spectrum of the\nmaterial using the conditional variational encoder (cVAE) with\nneural network models as the backbone. Such models can\ngenerate the UV-vis spectrum directly from a simple material\nimage, offering much faster material characterizations. Predicting\ngas adsorption isotherms for direct air capture (DAC) are also an\nimportant application of spectra-based DL models. There have\nbeen several important works206,207 for CO2 capture with high-\nperformance metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which are impor-\ntant for mitigating climate change issues.\nIMAGE-BASED MODELS\nComputer vision is often credited as precipitating the current\nwave of mainstream DL applications a decade ago208. Naturally,\nmaterials researchers have developed a broad portfolio of\napplications of computer vision for accelerating and improving\nimage-based material\ncharacterization\ntechniques.\nHigh-level\nmicroscopy vision tasks can be organized as follows: image\nclassiﬁcation (and material property regression), auto-tuning\nexperimental imaging hyperparameters, pixelwise learning (e.g.,\nsemantic segmentation), super-resolution imaging, object/entity\nrecognition, localization, and tracking, microstructure representa-\ntion learning.\nOften these tasks generalize across many different imaging\nmodalities, spanning optical microscopy (OM), scanning elec-\ntron microscopy (SEM) techniques, scanning probe microscopy\n(SPM, as in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy\n(TEM) variants, including scanning transmission electron micro-\nscopy (STEM).\nThe images obtained with these techniques range from\ncapturing local atomic to mesoscale structures (microstructure),\nthe distribution and type of defects, and their dynamics which are\ncritically linked to the functionality and performance of the\nmaterials. Over the past few decades, atomic-scale imaging has\nbecome widespread and near-routine due to aberration-corrected\nSTEM209. The collection of large image datasets is increasingly\npresenting an analysis bottleneck in the materials characterization\npipeline, and the immediate need for automated image analysis\nbecomes important. Non-DL image analysis methods have driven\ntremendous progress in quantitative microscopy, but often image\nprocessing pipelines are brittle and require too much manual\nidentiﬁcation of image features to be broadly applicable. Thus, DL\nis currently the most promising solution for high-performance,\nhigh-throughput automated analysis of image datasets. For a\ngood overview of applications in microstructure characterization\nspeciﬁcally, see210.\nDatabases and software libraries\nImage datasets for materials can come from either experiments\nor simulations. Software libraries mentioned above can be used\nto generate images such as STM/STEM. Images can also be\nobtained from the literature. A few common examples for image\ndatasets are shown below in Table 4. Recently, there has been a\nrapid development in the ﬁeld of image learning tasks for\nmaterials leading to several useful packages. We list some of\nthem in Table 4.\nApplications in image classiﬁcation and regression\nDL for images can be used to automatically extract information\nfrom images or transform images into a more useful state. The\nbeneﬁts of automated image analysis include higher throughput,\nbetter\nconsistency\nof\nmeasurements\ncompared\nto\nmanual\nanalysis, and even the ability to measure signals in images that\nhumans cannot detect. The beneﬁts of altering images include\nimage super-resolution, denoising, inferring 3D structure from 2D\nimages, and more. Examples of the applications of each task are\nsummarized below.\nImage classiﬁcation and regression\nClassiﬁcation and regression are the processes of predicting one\nor more values associated with an image. In the context of DL the\nonly difference between the two methods is that the outputs of\nclassiﬁcation are discrete while the outputs of regression models\nare continuous. The same network architecture may be used for\nboth classiﬁcation and regression by choosing the appropriate\nactivation function (i.e., linear for regression or Softmax for\nclassiﬁcation) for the output of the network. Due to its simplicity\nimage classiﬁcation is one of the most established DL techniques\navailable in the materials science literature. Nonetheless, this\ntechnique remains an area of active research.\nModarres et al. applied DL with transfer learning to auto-\nmatically classify SEM images of different material systems211.\nThey demonstrated how a single approach can be used to identify\na wide variety of features and material systems such as particles,\nﬁbers, Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, and more.\nThe model achieved 90% accuracy on a test set. Misclassiﬁcations\nresulted from images containing objects from multiple classes,\nwhich is an inherent limitation of single-class classiﬁcation. More\nadvanced techniques such as those described in subsequent\nsections can be applied to avoid these limitations. Additionally,\nthey developed a system to deploy the trained model at scale to\nprocess thousands of images in parallel. This approach is essential\nfor large-scale, high-throughput experiments or industrial applica-\ntions of classiﬁcation. ImageNet-based deep transfer learning has\nalso been successfully applied for crack detection in macroscale\nmaterials images212,213, as well as for property prediction on small,\nnoisy, and heterogeneous industrial datasets214,215.\nDL has also been applied to characterize the symmetries of\nsimulated measurements of samples. In ref.\n216, Ziletti et al.\nobtained a large database of perfect crystal structures, introduced\ndefects into the perfect lattices, and simulated diffraction patterns\nfor each structure. DL models were trained to identify the space\ngroup of each diffraction patterns. The model achieved high\nclassiﬁcation performance, even on crystals with signiﬁcant\nnumbers of defects, surpassing the performance of conventional\nalgorithms for detecting symmetries from diffraction patterns.\nDL has also been applied to classify symmetries in simulated\nSTM measurements of 2D material systems217. DFT was used to\ngenerate simulated STM images for a variety of material systems.\nA convolutional neural network was trained to identify which of\nthe ﬁve 2D Bravais lattices each material belonged to using the\nsimulated STM image as input. The model achieved an average\nF1 score of around 0.9 for each lattice type.\nK. Choudhary et al.\n12\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nDL has also been used to improve the analysis of electron\nbackscatter diffraction (EBSD) data, with Liu et al.218 presenting\none of the ﬁrst DL-based solution for EBSD indexing capable of\ntaking an EBSD image as input and predicting the three Euler\nangles representing the orientation that would have led to the\ngiven EBSD pattern. However, they considered the three Euler\nangles to be independent of each other, creating separate CNNs\nfor each angle, although the three angles should be considered\ntogether. Jha et al.219 built upon that work to train a single DL\nmodel to predict the three Euler angles in simulated EBSD\npatterns of polycrystalline Ni while directly minimizing the\nmisorientation angle between the true and predicted orientations.\nWhen tested on experimental EBSD patterns, the model achieved\n16% lower disorientation error than dictionary-based indexing.\nSimilarly, Kaufman et al. trained a CNN to predict the correspond-\ning space group for a given diffraction pattern220. This enables\nEBSD to be used for phase identiﬁcation in samples where the\nexisting phases are unknown, providing a faster or more cost-\neffective\nmethod\nof\ncharacterizing\nthan\nX-ray\nor\nneutron\ndiffraction. The results from these studies demonstrate the\npromise of applying DL to improve the performance and utility\nof EBSD experiments.\nRecently, DL has also been to learn crystal plasticity using\nimages of strain proﬁles as input221,222. The work in ref. 221 used\ndomain knowledge integration in the form of two-point auto-\ncorrelation to enhance the predictive accuracy, while222 applied\nresidual learning to learn crystal plasticity at nanoscale. It used\nstrain proﬁles of materials of varying sample widths ranging from\n2 μm down to 62.5 nm obtained from discrete dislocation\ndynamics to build a deep residual network capable of identifying\nprior deformation history of the sample as low, medium, or high.\nCompared to the correlation function-based method (68.24%\naccuracy), the DL model was found to be signiﬁcantly more\naccurate (92.48%) and also capable of predicting stress-strain\ncurves of test samples. This work additionally used saliency maps\nto try to interpret the developed DL model.\nPixelwise learning\nDL can also be applied to generate one or more predictions for\nevery pixel in an image. This can provide more detailed\ninformation about the size, position, orientation, and morphology\nof features of interest in images. Thus, pixelwise learning has been\na signiﬁcant area of focus with many recent studies appearing in\nmaterials science literature.\nAzimi et al. applied an ensemble of fully convolutional neural\nnetworks to segment martensite, tempered martensite, bainite,\nand pearlite in SEM images of carbon steels. Their model achieved\n94% accuracy, demonstrating a signiﬁcant improvement over\nprevious efforts to automate the segmentation of different phases\nin SEM images. Decost, Francis, and Holm applied PixelNet to\nsegment microstructural constituents in the UltraHigh Carbon\nSteel Database223,224. In contrast to fully convolutional neural\nnetworks, which encode and decode visual signals using a series\nof convolution layers, PixelNet constructs “hypercolumns”, or\nconcatenations of feature representations corresponding to each\npixel at different layers in a neural network. The hypercolumns are\ntreated as individual feature vectors, which can then be classiﬁed\nusing\nany\ntypical\nclassiﬁcation\napproach,\nlike\na\nmultilayer\nperceptron. This approach achieved phase segmentation precision\nand recall scores of 86.5% and 86.5%, respectively. Additionally,\nthis approach was used to segment spheroidite particles in the\nmatrix, achieving precision and recall scores of 91.1% and 91.1%,\nrespectively.\nPixelwise DL has also been applied to automatically segment\ndislocations in Ni superalloys210. Dislocations are visually similar\nto γ \u0001 γ0 and dislocation in Ni superalloys. With limited training\ndata, a single segmentation model could not distinguish\nTable 4.\nDatabases and software packages for applying DL methods\nfor image applications.\nDatabases\nDB Name\nLink\nRef.\nJARVIS-STM\nhttps://jarvis.nist.gov/jarvisstm\n217\natomagined\nhttps://github.com/MaterialEyes/\natomagined\n352\ndeep damage\nhttps://git.rwth-aachen.de/Sandra.Korte.\nKerzel/DeepDamage\n230\nNanoSEM\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.172\n353\nUHCSDB\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/11256/940\n223\nUHCS micro.

To overcome this, a second model was\ntrained to generate a coarse mask corresponding to the\ndeformed region in the material. Overlaying this mask with\npredictions from the ﬁrst model selects the dislocations,\nenabling them to be distinguished from γ \u0001 γ0 interfaces.\nStan, Thompson, and Voorhees applied Pixelwise DL to\ncharacterize dendritic growth from serial sectioning and synchro-\ntron computed tomography data225. Both of these techniques\ngenerate\nlarge\namounts\nof\ndata,\nmaking\nmanual\nanalysis\nimpractical. Conventional image processing approaches, utilizing\nthresholding, edge detectors, or other hand-crafted ﬁlters, cannot\neffectively deal with noise, contrast gradients, and other artifacts\nthat are present in the data. Despite having a small training set of\nlabeled images, SegNet automatically segmented these images\nwith much higher performance.\nObject/entity recognition, localization, and tracking\nObject detection or localization is needed when individual\ninstances of recognized objects in a given image need to be\ndistinguished from each other. In cases where instances do not\noverlap each other by a signiﬁcant amount, individual instances\ncan be resolved through post-processing of semantic segmenta-\ntion outputs. This technique has been applied extensively to\ndetect individual atoms and defects in microstructural images.\nMadsen et al. applied pixelwise DL to detect atoms in simulated\natomic-resolution TEM images of graphene226. A neural network\nwas trained to detect the presence of each atom as well as predict\nits column height. Pixelwise results are used as seeds for\nwatershed segmentation to achieve instance-level detection.\nAnalysis of the arrangement of the atoms led to the autonomous\ncharacterization of defects in the lattice structure of the material.\nInterestingly, despite being trained only on simulations, the model\nsuccessfully detected atomic positions in experimental images.\nMaksov et al. demonstrated atomistic defect recognition and\ntracking across sequences of atomic-resolution STEM images of\nWS2227. The lattice structure and defects existing in the ﬁrst frame\nwere characterized through a physics-based approach utilizing\nFourier transforms. The positions of atoms and defects in the ﬁrst\nframe were used to train a segmentation model. Despite only\nusing the ﬁrst frame for training, the model successfully identiﬁed\nand tracked defects in the subsequent frames for each sequence,\neven\nwhen\nthe\nlattice\nunderwent\nsigniﬁcant\ndeformation.\nSimilarly, Yang et al.228 used U-net architecture (as shown in\nFig. 4) to detect vacancies and dopants in WSe2 in STEM images\nwith model accuracy of up to 98%. They classiﬁed the possible\natomic sites based on experimental observations into ﬁve\ndifferent types: tungsten, vanadium substituting for tungsten,\nselenium with no vacancy, mono-vacancy of selenium, and di-\nvacancy of selenium.\nRoberts et al. developed DefectSegNet to automatically identify\ndefects in transmission and STEM images of steel including\ndislocations, precipitates, and voids229. They provide detailed\ninformation on the model’s design, training, and evaluation. They\nalso compare measurements generated from the model to\nmanual measurements performed by several different human\nexperts, demonstrating that the measurements generated by DL\nare quantitatively more accurate and consistent.\nKusche et al. applied DL to localize defects in panoramic SEM\nimages of dual-phase steel230. Manual thresholding was applied to\nidentify dark defects against the brighter matrix. Regions contain-\ning defects were classiﬁed via two neural networks. The ﬁrst neural\nnetwork distinguished between inclusions and ductile damage in\nthe material. The second classiﬁed the type of ductile damage (i.e.,\nnotching,\nmartensite\ncracking,\netc.)\nEach\ndefect\nwas\nalso\nsegmented\nvia\na\nwatershed\nalgorithm\nto\nobtain\ndetailed\ninformation on its size, position, and morphology.\nApplying DL to localize defects and atomic structures is a\npopular area in materials science research. Thus, several other\nrecent studies on these applications can be found in the\nliterature231–234.\nIn the above examples pixelwise DL, or classiﬁcation models are\ncombined with image analysis to distinguish individual instances\nof detected objects.

Choudhary et al.\n14\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nthe same class touch or overlap each other in the image, this\napproach will falsely detect them to be a single, larger object. In\nthis case, DL models designed for the detection or instance\nsegmentation can be used to resolve overlapping instances. In\none such study, Cohn and Holm applied DL for instance-level\nsegmentation of individual particles and satellites in dense\npowder images235. Segmenting each particle allows for computer\nvision to generate detailed size and morphology information\nwhich\ncan\nbe\nused\nto\nsupplement\nexperimental\npowder\ncharacterization for additive manufacturing. Additionally, over-\nlaying the powder and satellite masks yielded the ﬁrst method for\nquantifying the satellite content of powder samples, which cannot\nbe measured experimentally.\nSuper-resolution imaging and auto-tuning experimental\nparameters\nThe studies listed so far focus on automating the analysis of\nexisting data after it has been collected experimentally. However,\nDL can also be applied during experiments to improve the quality\nof the data itself. This can reduce the time for data collection or\nimprove the amount of information captured in each image.\nSuper-resolution and other DL techniques can also be applied\nin situ to autonomously adjust experimental parameters.\nRecording high-resolution electron microscope images often\nrequire large dwell times, limiting the throughput of microscopy\nexperiments. Additionally, during imaging, interactions between\nthe electron beam and a microscopy sample can result in\nundesirable effects, including charging of non-conductive samples\nand damage to sensitive samples. Thus, there is interest in using\nDL to artiﬁcially increase the resolution of images without\nintroducing these artifacts. One method of interest is applying\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) for this application.\nDe Haan et al. recorded SEM images of the same regions of\ninterest in carbon samples containing gold nanoparticles at two\nresolutions236. Low-resolution images recorded were used as\ninputs to a GAN. The corresponding images with twice the\nresolution were used as the ground truth. After training the GAN\nreduced the number of undetected gaps between nanoparticles\nfrom 13.9 to 3.7%, indicating that super-resolution was successful.\nThus, applying DL led to a four-fold reduction of the interaction\ntime between the electron beam and the sample.\nEde and Beanland collected a dataset of STEM images of\ndifferent samples237. Images were subsampled with spiral and\n‘jittered’ grid masks to obtain partial images with resolutions\nreduced by a factor up to 100. A GAN was trained to reconstruct\nfull images from their corresponding partial images. The results\nindicated that despite a signiﬁcant reduction in the sampling area,\nthis approach successfully reconstructed high-resolution images\nwith relatively small errors.\nDL has also been applied to automated tip conditioning for SPM\nexperiments. Rashidi and Wolkow trained a model to detect\nartifacts in SPM measurements resulting from degradation in tip\nquality238. Using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks\nresulted in 99% accuracy. After detecting that a tip has degraded,\nthe SPM was conﬁgured to automatically recondition the tip\nin situ until the network indicated that the atomic sharpness of\nthe tip has been restored. Monitoring and reconditioning the tip is\nthe most time and labor-intensive part of conducting SPM\nexperiments. Thus, automating this process through DL can\nincrease the throughput and decrease the cost of collecting data\nthrough SPM.\nIn addition to materials characterization, DL can be applied to\nautonomously adjust parameters during manufacturing. Scime\net al. mounted a camera to multiple 3D printers239. Images of the\nbuild plate were recorded throughout the printing process. A\ndynamic segmentation convolutional neural network was trained\nto recognize defects such as recoater streaking, incomplete\nspreading, spatter, porosity, and others. The trained model\nachieved high performance and was transferable to multiple\nprinters from three different methods of additive manufacturing.\nThis work is the ﬁrst step to enabling smart additive manufactur-\ning machines that can correct defects and adjust parameters\nduring printing.\nThere is also growing interest in establishing instruments and\nlaboratories for autonomous experimentation. Eppel et al. trained\nmultiple models to detect chemicals, materials, and transparent\nvessels in a chemistry lab setting240. This study provides a rigorous\nanalysis of several different approaches for scene understanding.\nModels were trained to characterize laboratory scenes with\ndifferent methods including semantic segmentation and instance\nsegmentation, both with and without overlapping instances. The\nmodels successfully detected individual vessels and materials in a\nvariety of settings. Finer-grained understanding of the contents of\nvessels, such as segmentation of individual phases in multi-phase\nsystems, was limited, outlining the path for future work in this\narea. The results represent an important step towards realizing\nautomated experimentation for laboratory-scale experiments.\nMicrostructure representation learning\nMaterials microstructure is often represented in the form of multi-\nphase high-dimensional 2D/3D images and thus can readily\nleverage\nimage-based\nDL\nmethods\nto\nlearn\nrobust,\nlow-\ndimensional microstructure representations, which can subse-\nquently be used for building predictive and generative models to\nlearn forward and inverse structure-property linkages, which are\ntypically\nstudied\nacross\ndifferent\nlength\nscales\n(multi-scale\nmodeling). In this context, homogenization and localization refer\nto the transfer of information from lower length scales to higher\nlength scales and vice-versa. DL using customized CNNs has been\nused both for homogenization, i.e., predicting the macroscale\nproperty of material given its microstructure information221,241,242,\nas well as for localization, i.e., predicting the strain distribution\nacross a given microstructure for a loading condition243.\nTransfer learning has also been widely used for analyzing\nmaterials microstructure images; methods for improving the use\nof transfer learning to materials science applications remain an\narea of active research. Goetz et al. investigated the use of\nunsupervised domain adaptation as an alternative to simply ﬁne-\ntuning a pre-trained model244. In this technique a model is ﬁrst\ntrained on a labeled dataset in the source domain. Next, a\ndiscriminator model is used to train the model to generate\ndomain-agnostic\nfeatures.\nCompared\nto\nsimple\nﬁne-tuning,\nunsupervised domain adaptation improved the performance of\nclassiﬁcation and segmentation neural networks on materials\nscience datasets. However, it was determined that the highest\nperformance was achieved when the source domain was more\nvisually similar to the target (for example, using a different set of\nmicrostructural images instead of ImageNet.) This highlights the\nutility\nof\nestablishing\nlarge,\npublicly\navailable\ndatasets\nof\nannotated images in materials science.\nKitaraha and Holm used the output of an intermediate layer of a\npre-trained convolutional neural network as a feature representa-\ntion for images of steel surface defects and Inconnel fracture\nsurfaces245. Images were classiﬁed by defect type or fracture\nsurface orientation using unsupervised DL. Even though no\nlabeled data was used to train the neural network or the\nunsupervised classiﬁer, the model found natural decision bound-\naries that achieved a classiﬁcation performance of 98% and 88%\nfor the defect classes and fracture surface orientations, respec-\ntively. Visualization of the representations through principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor-\nhood embedding (t-SNE) provided qualitative insights into the\nrepresentations. Although the detailed physical interpretation of\nthe representations is still a distant goal, this study provides tools\nK. Choudhary et al.\n15\nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nfor investigating patterns in visual signals contained in image-\nbased datasets in materials science.\nLarmuseau et al. investigated the use of triplet networks to\nobtain consistent representations for visually similar images of\nmaterials246. Triplet networks are trained with three images at a\ntime. The ﬁrst image, the reference, is classiﬁed by the network.\nThe second image, called the positive, is another image with the\nsame class label. The last image, called the negative, is an image\nfrom a separate class. During training the loss function includes\nerrors in predicting the class of the reference image, the difference\nin representations of the reference and positive images, and the\nsimilarity in representations of the reference and negative images.\nThis process allows the network to learn consistent representa-\ntions for images in the same class while distinguishing images\nfrom different classes. The triple network outperformed an\nordinary convolutional neural network trained for image classiﬁca-\ntion on the same dataset.\nIn addition to investigating representations used to analyze\nexisting images, DL can generate synthetic images of materials\nsystems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are currently the\npredominant method for synthetic microstructure generation.\nGANs consist of a generator, which creates a synthetic micro-\nstructure image, and a discriminator, which attempts to predict if a\ngiven input image is real or synthetic. With careful application,\nGANs can be a powerful tool for microstructure representation\nlearning and design.\nYang and Li et al.247,248 developed a GAN-based model for\nlearning a low-dimensional embedding of microstructures, which\ncould then be easily sampled and used with the generator of the\nGAN model to generate realistic, statistically similar microstructure\nimages, thus enabling microstructural materials design. The model\nwas able to capture complex, nonlinear microstructure character-\nistics and learn the mapping between the latent design variables\nand microstructures. In order to close the loop, the method was\ncombined with a Bayesian optimization approach to design\nmicrostructures with optimal optical absorption performance. The\ndiscovered microstructures were found to have up to 17% better\nproperty than randomly sampled microstructures. The unique\narchitecture of their GAN model also facilitated generator\nscalability to generate arbitrary-sized microstructure images and\ndiscriminator transferability to build structure-property prediction\nmodels. Yang et al.249 recently combined GANs with MDNs\n(mixture\ndensity networks)\nto enable\ninverse modeling\nin\nmicrostructural materials design, i.e., generate the microstructure\nfor a given desired property.\nHsu et al. constructed a GAN to generate 3D synthetic solid\noxide fuel cell microstructures250. These microstructures were\ncompared to other synthetic microstructures generated by\nDREAM.3D as well as experimentally observed microstructures\nmeasured via sectioning and imaging with PFIB-SEM. Synthetic\nmicrostructures generated from the GAN were observed to\nqualitatively show better agreement to the experimental micro-\nstructures than the DREAM.3D microstructures, as evidenced by\nthe more realistic phase connectivity and lower amount of\nagglomeration of solid phases. Additionally, a statistical analysis\nof various features such as volume fraction, particle size, and\nseveral other quantities demonstrated that the GAN microstruc-\ntures were quantitatively more similar to the real microstructures\nthan the DREAM.3D microstructures.\nIn a similar study, Chun et al. generated synthetic microstruc-\ntures of high energy materials using a GAN251. Once again, a\nsynthetic microstructure generated via GAN showed better\nqualitative visual similarity to an experimentally observed micro-\nstructure compared to a synthetic microstructure generated via a\ntransfer learning approach, with sharper phase boundaries and\nfewer computational artifacts. Additionally, a statistical analysis of\nthe void size, aspect ratio, and orientation distributions indicated\nthat the GAN produced microstructures that were quantitatively\nmore similar to real materials.\nApplications of DL to microstructure representation learning\ncan help researchers improve the performance of predictive\nmodels used for the applications listed above. Additionally, using\ngenerative models can generate more realistic simulated micro-\nstructures. This can help researchers develop more accurate\nmodels for predicting material properties and performance\nwithout needing to synthesize and process these materials,\nsigniﬁcantly increasing the throughput of materials selection\nand screening experiments.\nMesoscale modeling applications\nIn addition to image-based characterization,\ndeep learning\nmethods are increasingly used in mesoscale modeling. Dai\net al.252 trained a GNN successfully trained to predict magnetos-\ntriction in a wide range of synthetic polycrystalline systems with\naround 10% prediction error. The microstructure is represented by\na graph where each node corresponds to a single grain, and the\nedges between nodes indicate an interface between neighboring\ngrains. Five node features (3 Euler angles, volume, and the number\nof neighbors) were associated with each grain. The GNN\noutperformed other machine learning approaches for property\nprediction of polycrystalline materials by accounting for interac-\ntions between neighboring grains.\nSimilarly, Cohn and Holm present preliminary work applying\nGNNs to predict the occurrence of abnormal grain growth (AGG)\nin Monte Carlo simulations of microstructure evolution253. AGG\nappears to be stochastic, making it notoriously difﬁcult to predict,\ncontrol, and even observe experimentally in some materials. AGG\nhas been reproduced in Monte Carlo simulations of material\nsystems, but a model that can predict which initial microstructures\nwill undergo AGG has not been established before. A dataset of\nMonte Carlo simulations was created using SPPARKS254,255. A\nmicrostructure GNN was trained to predict AGG in individual\nsimulations, with 75% classiﬁcation accuracy. In comparison, an\nimage-based only achieved 60% accuracy. The GNN also provided\nphysical insight to understanding AGG and indicated that only 2\nneighborhood shells are needed to achieve the maximum\nperformance achieved in the study. These early results motivate\nadditional work on applying GNNs to predict the occurrence in\nboth simulated and real materials during processing.\nNATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING\nMost of the existing knowledge in the materials domain is\ncurrently unavailable as structured information and only exists as\nunstructured text, tables, or images in various publications. There\nexists a great opportunity to use natural language processing\n(NLP) techniques to convert text to structured data or to directly\nlearn and make inferences from the text information. However,\nas\na\nrelatively\nnew\nﬁeld\nwithin\nmaterials\nscience,\nmany\nchallenges remain unsolved in this domain, such as resolving\ndependencies between words and phrases across multiple\nsentences and paragraphs.\nDatasets for NLP\nDatasets relevant to natural language processing include peer-\nreviewed journal articles, articles published on preprint servers\nsuch as arXiv or ChemRxiv, patents, and online material such as\nWikipedia. Unfortunately, accessing or parsing most such datasets\nremains difﬁcult. Peer-reviewed journal articles are typically\nsubject to copyright restrictions and thus difﬁcult to obtain,\nespecially in the large numbers required for machine learning.\nMany publishers now offer text and data mining (TDM) agree-\nments that can be signed online, allowing at least a limited,\nrestricted amount of work to be performed. However, gaining\nK. Choudhary et al.\n16\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\naccess to the full text of many publications still typically requires\nstrict and dedicated agreements with each publisher. The major\nadvantage of working with publishers is that they have often\nalready converted the articles from a document format such as\nPDF into an easy-to-parse format such as HyperText Markup\nLanguage (HTML). In contrast, articles on preprint servers and\npatents are typically available with fewer restrictions, but are\ncommonly available only as PDF ﬁles. It remains difﬁcult to\nproperly parse text from PDF ﬁles in a reliable manner, even when\nthe text is embedded in the PDF. Therefore, new tools that can\neasily and automatically convert such content into well-structured\nHTML format with few residual errors would likely have a major\nimpact on the ﬁeld. Finally, online sources of information such as\nWikipedia can serve as another type of data source. However, such\nonline sources are often more difﬁcult to verify in terms of\naccuracy and also do not contain as much domain-speciﬁc\ninformation as the research literature.\nSoftware libraries for NLP\nApplying NLP to a raw dataset involves multiple steps. These steps\ninclude retrieving the data, various forms of “pre-processing”\n(sentence and word tokenization, word stemming and lemmatiza-\ntion, featurization such as word vectors or part of speech tagging),\nand ﬁnally machine learning for information extraction (e.g.,\nnamed entity recognition, entity-relationship modeling, question\nand answer, or others). Multiple software libraries exist to aid in\nmaterials NLP, as described in Table 5. We note that although\nmany of these steps can in theory be performed by general-\npurpose NLP libraries such as NLTK256, SpaCy257, or AllenNLP258,\nthe specialized nature of chemistry and materials science text\n(including the presence of complex chemical formulas) often leads\nto errors. For example, researchers have developed specialized\ncodes to perform preprocessing that better detect chemical\nformulas (and not split them into separate tokens or apply\nstemming/lemmatization to them) and scientiﬁc phrases and\nnotation such as oxidation states or symbols for physical units.\nSimilarly, chemistry-speciﬁc codes for extracting entities are\nbetter at extracting the names of chemical elements (e.g.,\nrecognizing that “He” likely represents helium and not a male\npronoun) and abbreviations for chemical formulas. Finally, word\nembeddings that convert words such as “manganese” into\nnumerical vectors for further data mining are more informative\nwhen trained speciﬁcally on materials science text versus more\ngeneric texts, even when the latter datasets are larger259. Thus,\ndomain-speciﬁc tools for NLP are required in nearly all aspects of\nthe pipeline. The main exception is that the architecture of the\nspeciﬁc neural network models used for information extraction\n(e.g., LSTM, BERT, or architectures used to generate word\nembeddings such as word2vec or GloVe) are typically not\nmodiﬁed speciﬁcally for the materials domain. Thus, much of\nthe materials and chemistry-centric work currently regards data\nretrieval and appropriate preprocessing. A longer discussion of\nthis topic, with speciﬁc examples, can be found in refs. 260,261.\nApplications\nNLP methods for materials have been applied for information\nextraction\nand\nsearch\n(particularly\nas\napplied\nto synthesis\nprediction) as well as materials discovery. As the domain is rapidly\ngrowing, we suggest dedicated reviews on this topic by Olivetti\net al.261 and Kononova et al.260 for more information.\nOne of the major uses of NLP methods is to extract datasets\nfrom the text in published studies. Conventionally, such datasets\nrequired manual entry of datasets by researchers combing the\nliterature, a laborious and time-consuming process. Recently,\nsoftware tools such as ChemDataExtractor262 and other meth-\nods263 based on more conventional machine learning and rule-\nbased approaches have enabled automated or semi-automated\nextraction of datasets such as Curie and Néel magnetic phase\ntransition temperatures264, battery properties265, UV-vis spectra266,\nand surface and pore characteristics of metal-organic frame-\nworks267. In the past few years, DL approaches such as LSTMs and\ntransformer-based models have been employed to extract various\ncategories of information268, and in particular materials synthesis\ninformation269–271 from text sources. Such data have been used to\npredict synthesis maps for titania nanotubes272, various binary and\nternary oxides273, and perovskites274.\nDatabases based on natural language processing have also\nbeen used to train machine learning models to identify materials\nwith useful functional properties, such as the recent discovery of\nthe large magnetocaloric properties of HoBe2275. Similarly,\nCooper et al.276 demonstrated a “design to device approach”\nfor designing dye-sensitized solar cells that are co-sensitized\nwith two dyes276. This study used automated text mining to\ncompile a list of candidate dyes for the application along with\nmeasured properties such as maximum absorption wavelengths\nand extinction coefﬁcients. The resulting list of 9431 dyes\nextracted from the literature was downselected to 309 candi-\ndates using various criteria such as molecular structure and\nability to absorb in the solar spectrum. These candidates were\nevaluated for suitable combinations for co-sensitization, yielding\n33 dyes that were further downselected using density functional\ntheory calculations and experimental constraints. The resulting 5\ndyes were evaluated experimentally, both individually and in\ncombinations, resulting in a combination of dyes that not only\noutperformed any of the individual dyes but demonstrated\nperformance comparable to existing standard material. This\nstudy demonstrates the possibility of using literature-based\nextraction to identify materials candidates for new applications\nfrom the vast body of published work, which may have never\ntested those materials for the desired application.\nIt is even possible that natural language processing can directly\nmake materials predictions without intermediary models. In a\nstudy reported by Tshitoyan et al.259 (as shown in Fig. 5), word\nembeddings (i.e., numerical vectors representing distinct words)\ntrained on materials science literature could directly predict\nmaterials applications through a simple dot product between the\ntrained embedding for a composition word (such as PbTe) and an\napplication words (such as thermoelectrics). The researchers\ndemonstrated that such an approach, if applied in the past using\nhistorical data, may have subsequently predicted many recently\nTable 5.\nSoftware packages for applying DL to natural language\nprocessing.\nSoftware name\nLink\nRef.\nBorges\nhttps://github.com/CederGroupHub/Borges\n270\nChemDataExtractor http://chemdataextractor.org\n262\nChemicalTagger\nhttps://github.com/BlueObelisk/\nchemicaltagger\n369\nChemListem\nhttps://bitbucket.org/rscapplications/\nchemlistem/\n370\nChemSpot\nhttps://github.com/rockt/ChemSpot\n371\nLBNLP\nhttps://github.com/lbnlp/lbnlp\n268\nmat2vec\nhttps://github.com/materialsintelligence/\nmat2vec\n259\nMaterialsParser\nhttps://github.com/CederGroupHub/\nMaterialParser\n271\nOSCAR4\nhttps://github.com/BlueObelisk/oscar4\n372\nSynthesis Project\nhttps://www.synthesisproject.org\n272\ntmChem\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/\nbionlp/Tools/tmchem/\n373\nK. Choudhary et al.\n17\nPublished in partnership with the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\nnpj Computational Materials (2022)  59 \nreported thermoelectric materials; they also presented a list of\npotentially interesting thermoelectric compositions using the\nknown literature at the time. Since then, several of these\npredictions have been tested either computationally277–282 or\nexperimentally283 as potential thermoelectrics. Such approaches\nhave recently been applied to search for understudied areas of\nmetallocene catalysis284, although challenges still remain in such\ndirect approaches to materials prediction.\nUNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION\nUncertainty quantiﬁcation (UQ) is an essential step in evaluating\nthe robustness of DL. Speciﬁcally, DL models have been criticized\nfor lack of robustness, interpretability, and reliability and the\naddition of carefully quantiﬁed uncertainties would go a long way\ntowards addressing such shortcomings. While most of the focus in\nthe DL ﬁeld currently goes into developing new algorithms or\ntraining networks to high accuracy, there is increasing attention to\nUQ, as exempliﬁed by the detailed review of Abdar et al.285.\nHowever, determining the uncertainty associated with DL predic-\ntions is still challenging and far from a completely solved problem.\nThe main drawback to estimating UQ when performing DL is\nthe fact that most of the currently available UQ implementations\ndo not work for arbitrary, off-the-shelf models, without retraining\nor redesigning. Bayesian NNs are the exception; however, they\nrequire signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to the training procedure, are\ncomputationally expensive compared to non-Bayesian NNs, and\nbecome increasingly inefﬁcient the larger the datasize gets. A\nconsiderable fraction of the current research in DL UQ focuses\nexactly on such an issue: how to evaluate uncertainty without\nrequiring\ncomputationally\nexpensive retraining\nor DL\ncode\nmodiﬁcations. An example of such an effort is the work of Mi\net al.286, where three scalable methods are explored, to evaluate\nthe variance of output from trained NN, without requiring any\namount of retraining. Another example is Teye, Azizpour, and\nSmith’s exploration of the use of batch normalization as a way to\napproximate inference in Bayesian models287.\nBefore reviewing the most common methods used to evaluate\nuncertainty in DL, let us brieﬂy point out key reasons to add UQ\nto DL modeling. Reaching high accuracy when training DL\nmodels implicitly assume the availability of a sufﬁciently large\nand diverse training dataset. Unfortunately, this rarely occurs in\nmaterial discovery applications288. ML/DL models are prone to\nperform poorly on extrapolation289. It is also extremely difﬁcult\nfor ML/DL models to recognize ambiguous samples290. In\ngeneral, determining the amount of data necessary to train a\nDL to achieve the required accuracy is a challenging problem.\nCareful\nevaluation\nof\nthe\nuncertainty\nassociated\nwith\nDL\npredictions would not only increase reliability in predicted\nresults but would also provide guidance on estimating the\nneeded training dataset size as well as suggesting what new data\nshould be added to reach the target accuracy (uncertainty-\nguided decision). Zhang, Kailkhura, and Han’s work emphasizes\nhow including a UQ-motivated reject option into the DL model\nsubstantially\nimproves\nthe\nperformance\nof\nthe\nremaining\nmaterial data288. Such a reject option is associated with the\ndetection of out-of-distribution samples, which is only possible\nthrough UQ analysis of the predicted results.\nTwo different uncertainty types are associated with each ML\nprediction: epistemic uncertainty and aleatory uncertainty. Epis-\ntemic uncertainty is related to insufﬁcient training data in part of\nthe input domain. As mentioned above, while DL is very effective\nat interpolation tasks, they can have more difﬁculty in extrapola-\ntion. Therefore, it is vital to quantify the lack of accuracy due to\nlocalized, insufﬁcient training data. The aleatory uncertainty,\ninstead, is related to parameters not included in the model. It\nrelates to the possibility of training on data that our DL perceives\nas very similar but that are associated with different outputs\nbecause of missing features in the model. Ideally, we would like\nUQ methodologies to distinguish and quantify both types of\nuncertainties separately.\nThe most common approaches to evaluate uncertainty using DL\nare Dropout methods, Deep Ensemble methods, Quantile regres-\nsion, and Gaussian Processes. Dropout methods are commonly\nused to avoid overﬁtting. In this type of approach, network nodes\nFig. 5\nA schematic showing the application of skip-gram variation of Word2vec for predicting context words. a Network for training word\nembeddings for natural language processing application. A one-hot encoded vector at left represents each distinct word in the corpus; the\nrole of a hidden layer is to predict the probability of neighboring words in the corpus. This network structure trains a relatively small hidden\nlayer of 100–200 neurons to contain information on the context of words in the entire corpus, with the result that similar words end up with\nsimilar hidden layer weights (word embeddings). Such word embeddings can transform wordsin text form into numerical vectors that may be\nuseful for a variety of applications. b projection of word embeddings for various materials science words, as trained on a corpus scientiﬁc\nabstracts, into two dimensions using principle components analysis.

When a\nsimilar randomization procedure is also applied to the prediction\nprocedure, the methodology becomes Monte-Carlo dropout291.\nRepeating such randomization multiple times produces a dis-\ntribution over the outputs, from which mean and variance are\ndetermined for each prediction. Another example of using a\ndropout approach to approximate Bayesian inference in deep\nGaussian processes is the work of Gal and Ghahramani292.\nDeep ensemble methodologies293–296 combine deep learning\nmodelling with ensemble learning. Ensemble methods utilize\nmultiple models and different random initializations to improve\npredictability. Because of the multiple predictions, statistical\ndistributions of the outputs are generated. Combining such\nresults into a Gaussian distribution, conﬁdence intervals are\nobtained\nthrough\nvariance\nevaluation.\nSuch\na\nmulti-model\nstrategy allows the evaluation of aleatory uncertainty when\nsufﬁcient training data are provided. For areas without sufﬁcient\ndata, the predicted mean and variance will not be accurate, but\nthe expectation is that a very large variance should be estimated,\nclearly indicating non-trustable predictions. Monte-Carlo Dropout\nand Deep Ensembles approaches can be combined to further\nimprove conﬁdence in the predicted outputs.\nQuantile regression can be utilized with DL297. In this\napproach, the loss function is used in a way that allows to\npredict for the chosen quantile a (between 0 and 1). A choice of\na = 0.5 corresponds to evaluating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\nand predicting the median of the distribution. Predicting for two\nmore quantile values (amin and amax) determines conﬁdence\nintervals of width amax −amin. For instance, predicting for amin =\n0.1 and amax = 0.8 produces conﬁdence intervals covering 70% of\nthe population. The largest drawback of using quantile to estimate\nprediction intervals is the need to run the model three times, one\nfor each quantile needed. However, a recent implementation in\nTensorFlow allows to simultaneously obtain multiple quantiles in\none run.\nLastly, Gaussian Processes (GP) can be used within a DL\napproach as well and have the side beneﬁt of providing UQ\ninformation at no extra cost. Gaussian processes are a family of\ninﬁnite-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions comple-\ntely speciﬁed by a mean function and a ﬂexible kernel function\n(prior distribution). By optimizing such functions to ﬁt the training\ndata, the posterior distribution is determined, which is later used\nto predict outputs for inputs not included in the training set.\nBecause the prior is a Gaussian process, the posterior distribution\nis Gaussian as well298, thus providing mean and variance\ninformation for each predicted data. However, in practice standard\nkernels under-perform299. In 2016, Wilson et al.300 suggested\nprocessing inputs through a neural network prior to a Gaussian\nprocess model. This procedure could extract high-level patterns\nand features, but required careful design and optimization. In\ngeneral, Deep Gaussian processes improve the performance of\nGaussian processes by mapping the inputs through multiple\nGaussian process ‘layers’. Several groups have followed this\navenue and further perfected such an approach (ref. 299 and\nreferences within). A common drawback of Bayesian methods is a\nprohibitive computational cost if dealing with large datasets292.\nLIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES\nAlthough DL methods have various fascinating opportunities for\nmaterials design, they have several limitations and there is much\nroom to improve. Reliability and quality assessment of datasets\nused in DL tasks are challenging because there is either a lack of\nground truth data, or there are not enough metrics for global\ncomparison, or datasets using similar or identical set-ups may not\nbe reproducible301. This poses an important challenge in relying\nupon DL-based prediction.\nMaterial representations based on chemical formula alone by\ndeﬁnition do not consider structure, which on the one hand\nmakes them more amenable to work for new compounds for\nwhich structure information may not be available, but on the\nother hand, makes it impossible for them to capture phenomena\nsuch\nas\nphase\ntransitions.\nProperties\nof\nmaterials\ndepend\nsensitively on structure to the extent that their properties can\nbe quite opposite depending on the atomic arrangement, like a\ndiamond (hard, wide-band-gap insulator) and graphite (soft, semi-\nmetal). It is thus not a surprise that chemical formula-based\nmethods may not be adequate in some cases159.\nAtomistic graph-based predictions, although considered a full\natomistic description, are tested on bulk materials only and not for\ndefective systems or for multi-dimensional phases of space\nexploration such as using genetic algorithms. In general, this\nunderscores that the input features must be predictive for the\noutput labels and not be missing some key information. Although\natomistic graph neural network models such as atomistic line\ngraph\nneural\nnetwork\n(ALIGNN)\nhave\nachieved\nremarkable\naccuracy compared to previous atomistic based models, the\nmodel errors still need to be further brought down to reach\nsomething resembling deep learning ‘chemical-accuracies.’\nIn terms of images and spectra, the experimental data are too\nnoisy most of the time and require much manipulation before\napplying DL. In contrast, theory-based simulated data represent an\nalternate path forward but may not capture realistic scenarios\nsuch as the presence of structured noise217.\nUncertainty quantiﬁcation for deep learning for materials\nscience is important, yet only a few works have been published\nin this ﬁeld. To alleviate the black-box38 nature of the DL\nmethods, a package such as GNNExplainer302 has been tried in\nthe context of the material. Such attempts at greater interpret-\nability will be important moving forward to gain the trust of the\nmaterials community.\nWhile training-validation-test split strategies were primarily\ndesigned in DL for image classiﬁcation tasks with a certain\nnumber of classes, the same for regression models in materials\nscience may not be the best approach. This is because it is\npossible that during the training the model is seeing a\nmaterial very similar to the test set material and in reality it is\ndifﬁcult to generalize the model. Best practices need to be\ndeveloped for data split, normalization, and augmentation to\navoid such issues289.\nFinally, we note an important technological challenge is to\nmake a closed-loop autonomous materials design and synthesis\nprocess303,304 that can include both machine learning and\nexperimental components in a self-driving laboratory305. For an\noverview of early proof of principle attempts see306. For example,\nin an autonomous synthesis experiment the oxidation state of\ncopper (and therefore the oxide phase) was varied in a sample of\ncopper oxide by automatically ﬂowing more oxidizing or more\nreducing gas over the sample and monitoring the charge state of\nthe copper using XANES. An algorithmic decision policy was then\nused\nto\nautomatically\nchange\nthe\ngas\ncomposition\nfor\na\nsubsequent experiment based on the prior experiments, with no\nhuman in the loop, in such a way as to autonomously move\ntowards a target copper oxidation state307. This simple proof of\nprinciple experiment provides just a glimpse of what is possible\nmoving forward.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe data from new ﬁgures are available on reasonable request from the\ncorresponding author.

Mental health care professionals can help people\nmanage conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar\ndisorder, addiction, and other disorders that affect their\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\nMental health can affect a person’s day-to-day life, relationships, and\nphysical health. External factors in people’s lives and relationships can\nalso contribute to their mental well-being.\nLooking after one’s mental health can help a person maintain their ability\nto enjoy life. This involves balancing their activities, responsibilities, and\nefforts to achieve psychological resilience.\nStress, depression, and anxiety can affect mental health and may disrupt\na person’s routine.\nAlthough healthcare professionals often use the term “mental health,”\ndoctors recognize that many mental health conditions have physical\nroots.\nThis article explains what mental health and mental health conditions\nmean. It also describes the most common types of mental health\ndisorders, including their early signs and how to treat them.\nDefinition\nRisk factors\nTypes of disorders\nEarly signs\nDiagnosis\nTreatment\nMyths vs. facts\nOutlook\nAdditional steps\nSummary\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nSUBSCRIBE\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n1/21\nChelsea Victoria/Stocksy\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) :\n“Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people\nto cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well\nand work well, and contribute to their community.”\nThe WHO states that mental health is “more than the absence of mental\ndisorders.” Peak mental health is about managing active conditions and\nmaintaining wellness and happiness.\nThe organization also emphasizes that preserving and restoring mental\nhealth is important at individual, community, and societal levels.\nThe WHO definition of mental health\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n2/21\nIn the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that\nalmost 1 in 5 adults experience mental health problems each year.\nIn 2021, an estimated 14.1 million adults  in the U.S., about 5.5% of the\nadult population, had a serious psychological condition, according to the\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).\nEveryone is at some risk of developing a mental health disorder,\nregardless of age, sex, income, or ethnicity. In the U.S. and much of the\ndeveloped world, depression is one of the leading causes  of disability.\nSocial and financial circumstances, adverse childhood experiences,\nbiological factors, and underlying medical conditions can all  shape a\nperson’s mental well-being.\nMany people with a mental health disorder have more than one \ncondition at the same time.\nIt is important to note that mental well-being depends on a balance of\nfactors, and several elements may contribute to the development of a\nmental health disorder.\nThe following factors can contribute to mental health conditions.\nSocioeconomic pressure\nHaving limited financial means or belonging to a marginalized ethnic\ngroup can increase the risk of mental health disorders as a result of\nbiases in healthcare.\nA 2015 Iranian study  describes several socioeconomic causes of mental\nhealth conditions, including poverty and living on the outskirts of a large\ncity.\nThe researchers also described flexible (modifiable) and inflexible\n(nonmodifiable) factors that can affect the availability and quality of mental\nhealth care treatment for certain groups.\nModifiable factors for mental health disorders include:\nRisk factors for mental health conditions\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n3/21\nsocioeconomic conditions, such as whether work is available in a\nlocal area\noccupation\na person’s level of social involvement\neducation\nhousing quality\nNonmodifiable factors include:\ngender\nage\nethnicity\nnationality\nThe researchers found that being female increased the risk of low mental\nhealth status by nearly four times. People with a “weak economic status”\nscored highest for mental health conditions in this study.\nChildhood adversity\nSeveral studies  report that childhood traumas such as child abuse,\nparental loss, parental separation, and parental illness significantly affect\na growing child’s mental and physical health.\nThere are associations between childhood abuse and other adverse\nevents and mental health disorders. These experiences also make people\nvulnerable to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nBiological factors\nThe NIMH suggests that a person’s family history can increase the\nlikelihood  of mental health conditions, as specific genes and gene\nvariants put a person at higher risk. However, having a gene associated\nwith a mental health disorder does not guarantee that a condition will\ndevelop.\nLikewise, people without related genes or a family history of mental\nhealth conditions may have a mental health disorder.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n4/21\nChronic stress and mental health disorders such as depression and\nanxiety may develop due to underlying physical health problems, such as\ncancer, diabetes, and chronic pain.\nMental health resources\nVisit our dedicated hub for more research-backed information\nand resources on mental health and well-being.\nHealthcare professionals group mental health disorders according to the\nfeatures they have in common. They include:\nanxiety disorders\nmood disorders\nschizophrenia disorders\nAnxiety disorders\nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety\ndisorders are the most common mental health disorders.\nPeople with these conditions have severe fear or anxiety related to\ncertain objects or situations. Most people with an anxiety disorder try to\navoid exposure to whatever triggers their anxiety.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTypes of mental health disorders\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n5/21\nBelow are some examples of anxiety disorders.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves excessive worry or fear that\ndisrupts everyday living.\nPeople may also experience physical symptoms, including:\nrestlessness\nfatigue\npoor concentration\ntense muscles\ninterrupted sleep\nAnxiety symptoms do not always have a specific trigger in people with\nGAD.\nThey may experience excessive anxiety when encountering everyday\nsituations that do not pose a direct danger, such as chores or\nappointments. A person with GAD may sometimes feel anxiety with no\ntrigger at all.\nPanic disorder\nPeople with panic disorder experience regular panic attacks involving\nsudden, overwhelming terror or a sense of imminent disaster and death.\nPhobias\nThere are many types of phobias, and what may seem typical to one\nperson might be a severe problem that dominates daily life for another.\nDifferent types include:\nSimple phobias: These may involve a disproportionate fear of\nspecific objects, scenarios, or animals. A fear of spiders is a typical\nexample.\nSocial phobia: Sometimes known as social anxiety, this is a fear of\nbeing watched or judged by others. People with social phobia often\nrestrict their exposure to social environments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n6/21\nAgoraphobia: The term “agoraphobia” refers to a fear of situations\nwhere getting away may be difficult, such as being in an elevator or\na moving train. People sometimes misunderstand this phobia as a\nfear of being outside.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder\nPeople with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may experience\nconstant, stressful thoughts and an urge to perform repetitive acts, such\nas handwashing.\nPTSD\nPTSD can occur after a person experiences or witnesses a stressful or\ntraumatic event. During this type of event, the person thinks their life or\nother people’s lives are in danger. They may feel afraid or that they have\nno control over what is happening.\nThese sensations of trauma and fear may then contribute to PTSD.\nMood disorders\nPeople may also refer to mood disorders as affective disorders or\ndepressive disorders.\nPeople with these conditions have significant mood changes, generally\ninvolving either mania, a period of high energy and joy, or depression.\nExamples of mood disorders include:\nMajor depression: An individual with major depression experiences\na constant low mood and loses interest in activities and events that\nthey previously enjoyed (anhedonia). They may feel prolonged\nperiods of sadness or extreme sadness.\nBipolar disorder: A person with bipolar disorder experiences\nunusual changes  in their mood, energy levels, levels of activity,\nand ability to continue with daily life. Periods of high mood are\nknown as manic phases, while depressive phases bring on low\nmood.\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD): Reduced daylight during the fall,\nwinter, and early spring months triggers SAD, a type of major\ndepression . It is most common in countries far from the equator.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n7/21\nRead more about the different types of bipolar disorder.\nSchizophrenia disorders\nThe term “schizophrenia” often refers to a spectrum of disorders\ncharacterized by features of psychosis and other severe symptoms.\nThese are highly complex conditions.\nAccording to the NIMH, signs of schizophrenia typically develop between\nthe ages of 16 and 30 . A person will have thoughts that appear\nfragmented, and may also find it hard to process information.\nSchizophrenia has negative and positive symptoms. Positive symptoms\ninclude delusions, thought disorders, and hallucinations, while withdrawal,\nlack of motivation, and a flat or inappropriate mood are examples of\nnegative symptoms.\nNo physical test or scan reliably indicates whether a person has\ndeveloped a mental health condition. However, people should look out\nfor the following as possible signs:\nwithdrawing from friends, family, and colleagues\navoiding activities they would usually enjoy\nsleeping too much or too little\neating too much or too little\nfeeling hopeless\nhaving consistently low energy\nusing mood-altering substances, including alcohol and nicotine,\nmore frequently\ndisplaying negative emotions\nbeing confused\nbeing unable to complete daily tasks, such as getting to work or\ncooking a meal\nhaving persistent thoughts or memories that reappear regularly\nthinking of causing physical harm to themselves or others\nEarly signs\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n8/21\nhearing voices\nexperiencing delusions\nDiagnosing a mental health disorder requires a multistep process. A\ndoctor may begin by looking at a person’s medical history and performing\na thorough physical exam to rule out a physical condition that may be\ncausing the symptoms. They may also order laboratory tests, such as\nimaging exams and bloodwork, to screen for possible underlying causes.\nThe healthcare professional will also do a psychological evaluation. This\nincludes asking about a person’s symptoms and experiences and how\nthese affect the individual’s life. The doctor may ask a person to complete\nmental health questionnaires to help understand their thoughts, feelings,\nand behavior patterns.\nMost mental health care professionals use the American Psychiatric\nAssociation’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\n5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR) to make a diagnosis. The DSM-5-TR\ncontains descriptions and specific criteria for a diagnosis.\nVarious methods are available to help manage mental health conditions.\nTreatment is highly individual, and what works for one person may not\nwork for another.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDiagnosis\nTreatment\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n21/05/2025, 22:17\nMental health: Definition, common disorders, early signs, and more\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154543\n9/21\nSome strategies or treatments are more successful in combination with\nothers. A person with a mental health disorder may choose different\noptions at various stages in their life.\nIt is important for an individual to work closely with a doctor who can help\nthem identify their needs and provide suitable treatment.\nBelow are some treatment options for people with mental health\nconditions.\nPsychotherapy, or talking therapies\nThe following types of therapy  take a psychological approach to treating\nmental health:\ncognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\nexposure therapy\ndialectical behavior therapy\nPsychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, and some primary care\nphysicians carry out these treatments.\nTherapy may help individuals to understand the cause of their mental\nhealth condition.

At times, these worldwide problems can seem \noverwhelming. We may ask ourselves questions about how to understand these complex problems \nand whether there’s anything we can do to make them better. This community response guide \nencourages young people to discover, understand, and act on the answers to these questions. \nIn the years leading up to 2015, people around the world worked together to share their ideas \nabout how our world should be. These ideas became a list of goals, the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. The goals represent a plan for a sustainable world: a world where peaceful \nsocieties collaborate; a world where we live in balance with the environment of our planet; a world \nin which our economies fulfill our needs; a world that is fair to all.\nAs youth around the globe engage with the activities in this guide, they will gain an understanding \nof the science that underlies the Sustainable Development Goals. They will be able to share their \nknowledge with their community, create tangible ways to help their community make informed \ndecisions, and understand the best places to find additional information on these topics. \nThroughout the guide, young people may find themselves asking many questions about fair \ntreatment of people and communities. You do not need to have the answers to any of these \nquestions. The most important thing you can offer young people is the opportunity to question, \ninvestigate, think critically and systemically, synthesize, and act. Ask the young people around you \nhow they are feeling and what they are thinking about as they learn this content. \nI am immensely grateful to the experts who helped to develop this guide—the InterAcademy \nPartnership, a collaboration of 140 national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine; \nour colleagues across the Smithsonian Institution; and the external subject matter experts who \ncontributed to this guide—for their perspectives and technical support in ensuring the science in \nthis guide is accurate. I also want to say a special thank you to the developer of this guide, Heidi \nGibson, for her thoughtful contributions to the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals project. \nWorking together—scientists, researchers, parents, caregivers, educators, youth—we can make \na better world for all. This guide is a step toward that grand collaboration.\nThank you for partnering with us to inspire our youth to build a better world.\nBest,Carol O’Donnell\nDr. Carol O’Donnell, Director\nSmithsonian Science Education Center\nDirector Letter\nBiotechnology!    About the Guide – Page xii    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nAbout this Community Research Guide\nThe goal of this guide is to prepare young people to take \nconsidered action on pressing global issues. Considered action \nmeans young people learn about a problem, connect it to the \nlarger system, consider all the complexities of the problem, \ndecide for themselves the best way to address it, and then \nexecute a solution. Through this process young people are \nprepared not only to take considered action on a specific issue, \nbut to build the skills needed to take action on all issues that \naffect them and their communities.\nLearners use scientific and socio-scientific investigations to \nunderstand their local communities, scientific principles, and \ninnovation possibilities. They then have a chance to immediately \napply this information to make decisions that are informed by \nthe results of their investigations. Along the way, young people \nare prompted to reflect, investigate, think critically, analyze, and \nbuild consensus. Engaging in these activities builds important \nskills of empowerment and agency, open-mindedness and \nreflection, equity and justice, and global-local interconnection. These sustainability mindsets prepare \nyoung people to take an active role in shaping the future of their communities and their world.\nREFLECTION\nAND\nOPEN-MINDEDNESS \nRELATIONSHIPS\nAND\nINTERCONNECTION\nAGENCY\nAND \nACTION-TAKING\nSHARED\nTRANSFORMATIVE \nFUTURES\nSUSTAINABILITY MINDSETS\nEQUITY \nAND \nJUSTICE\n© Smithsonian Institution\nFigure 1: Sustainability Mindsets.\nA Framework to Discover, Understand, and Act \nThroughout the guide, young people are prompted to Discover, Understand, and Act. The three parts \nof their learning journey are described here.\nDiscover\nYoung people already have a lot of information and opinions \nabout the world around them. In this guide, they are prompted \nto use that knowledge as an entry point. They will discover what \nthey already know and what questions they might have. They \nare encouraged to consider different perspectives and priorities. \nThis both empowers young people and provides an immediate \nrelevance and context for their investigations.\nUnderstand\nGathering new information is a primary goal of science. Using a \nwide variety of methods to do so helps young people understand \nthe problems related to sustainable communities. They need to \nunderstand the problems both abstractly and within the context \nof their local community. Designing and conducting real-world \ninvestigations and interpreting results encourages young people  \nto think like scientists. \nAct\nFinally, young people apply both their existing knowledge and their newly gathered information. \nFirst, they consider personal changes they could make to help make their communities more \nFigure 2: Global Goals Action Progression.\nAbout the Guide\nsustainable. Then, as a team, young people find consensus on what they could do, what they should \ndo, and what they will do. Teams then take action and reflect on the consequences, both intended \nand unintended.\nPedagogy Shift\nThis guide may feel like a big shift from the standard method of teaching. The guide is:\nLed by Young People\nTo make progress toward a better world, we need the ideas, enthusiasm, and energy of every young \nperson. We need them to help design and build the world in which they want to live. This means \nthroughout the guide young people make authentic decisions about what and how they will learn. \nTheir goal is to understand issues in their own community and take sustainable actions to make their \ncommunity and their world better.\nDriven by Data Collected by Young People\nIn this guide, the young people you teach will become action researchers. They will gather \ninformation about what sustainable communities mean in their own local spaces. This includes \nscientific investigations and experiments to understand the problems better, and also using social \nscience methods to understand their community better. Using science and social science helps \nyoung people arrive at a sustainable solution.\nFocused on Action\nThe goal of the guide is to help young people not just learn but also do. Throughout the guide young \npeople will conduct investigations and then use that knowledge to make decisions about the actions \nthat would be best for their community. They will then put those decisions into practice and see the \nresults of their actions.\nCustomized for Local Communities\nEach community is unique. While the world has global problems, the solutions must work locally. \nYoung people already have tremendous knowledge about their local community. This guide prompts \nthem to use that knowledge and find out new information to figure out solutions that are sustainable \nin their community.\nStructure of this Community Research Guide\nParts\nThis guide is made up of eight parts. Each part works with the others to help learners understand \nhow to help their community thrive and to put that knowledge to work by taking action.\nHowever, we recognize that time is a limiting factor in many learning spaces. Therefore, the guide is \ndesigned flexibly so it can be shortened, if necessary. The learners are guided to do this shortening \nwork themselves at the end of Part 1. The guide prompts learners to discuss with their teacher how \nmuch time is available and then make decisions about the best way to use that time.\nTasks\nWithin each part there are two tasks. Each task helps learners examine a different aspect of the topic \nthey are exploring. Within each task, there are three activities, which correspond to the Discover, \nUnderstand, Act framework. Discover activities focus on existing learner knowledge. Understand \nBiotechnology!    About the Guide – Page xiii    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nAbout the Guide\nBiotechnology!    About the Guide – Page xiv    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nactivities focus on gathering new information. Act activities focus on analyzing and applying that \nnew information to make decisions. Tasks also include perspectives and stories from experts around \nthe globe, so students can connect with the work of real-world scientists.\nUsing this Guide\nRoles\nThe Learner’s Role\nLearners are the decision-makers of the guide. They will decide what information they need and what \nthe information they gather means. Then learners use that information to decide and implement \nactions.\nThe Teacher’s Role\nThis guide may be challenging for learners, since they may be unfamiliar with their role. Learners \nmay need assistance in deciding what to do. Support and help them, but do not decide for them. Be \npatient. There are no right answers to the big questions posed by this guide. \nAdapting the Guide for Your Context\nDifferent Ages\nThis guide is designed to be used with young people between the ages of 8 and 17. This large range \nis deliberate to give access to these ideas to as many young people as possible. If you teach learners \nwho are on the younger end of the age range you may need to support them a little more. For \nexample, you might need to:\n• Explain more complex words or topics\n• Promote listening and tolerance in group discussions\n• Support group decision-making \n• Help them plan investigations in their community or accompany the teams on their \ninvestigations\n• Help learners think through the feasibility of the action they plan\n• Present alternate ways of capturing ideas; for example, if the guide suggests learners write, but \nthat is too difficult or is inappropriate for your learners, they can always draw, act out, or just talk \nabout their ideas\nIf you teach learners who are on the older end of the age range, the language of the guide might \nseem a little simple. However, older learners who can understand more complex ideas will be able to \ndevelop a more nuanced view of the problem and come up with more extensive solutions. \nAll young people should be able to engage with the guide in a way that is developmentally \nappropriate for them.\nDifferent Resources\nWe have assumed you have very basic classroom resources, such as a class board (blackboard or \nwhiteboard), paper, and pens or pencils. If it is not possible to capture learner writing, you can always \nhave learners act out or discuss their ideas. If you do not have the capacity to print out a Community \nResearch Guide for each learner, you or learner leaders can read the guide out loud from a single \nprint or digital copy.\nAbout the Guide\nBiotechnology!    About the Guide – Page xv    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nAccessibility\nThis guide is designed to be widely accessible. The language, tone, and format attempt to be as \ninclusive as possible to reach learners with a wide variety of learning styles. However, learners with \nspecific needs may need teacher support. As mentioned earlier, the guide activities can always be \nadapted to fit learner abilities, either by you or by the students themselves.\nDifferent Rules\nEach place is different and may have different rules to protect young people and privacy. For \nexample, in Part 7 of this guide there is an activity where young people explore using their \nfingerprints as biometric identification. Educators should follow local area guidance or regulations \nabout privacy.\nExtensions\nFor each part and many tasks there are additional activities, videos, and resources available digitally. \nThey can all be found at the Biotechnology! StoryMap at https://bit.ly/3pQUDpc.\nTeams\nMuch of the research, decision-making, and action is designed to be done in teams. These teams can \nrange in size from a group of two or three learners to the whole class. As a teacher, this is something \nto consider before beginning the Community Research Guide.\nIf you have motivated and responsible learners who need minimal teacher support, you may want to \nbreak your class into small teams. Smaller teams will allow individual learners to share their opinions \nand have more of an impact on team decision-making. With smaller teams, the experience can be more \ncustomized to the interests of the individual learner because there are fewer interests represented.\nIf you have learners who need more support, you may need to keep the class together in one team \nor have one team for each adult in the class. If you have only one team per adult, an adult can help \nsupport learners directly while they are engaging in activities such as conducting investigations and \nmaking decisions. However, because the team is larger, individual learners will have less of a voice in \ndecision-making and less impact on group actions.\nAlternately, if you have a group of learners with mixed abilities, you can design groups that bring \ntogether learners with different strengths. These types of groups can help learners support one \nanother rather than immediately turning to an adult for support.\nIf you are uncertain whether a small or large group is most appropriate for your learners, you may \nwant to wait and observe them during Task 1. In Task 1 in the Understand activity, learners break into \ngroups and conduct investigations. If learners are able to complete this task independently with fairly \nlimited teacher support, they would probably be successful in a small group. If learners need a great \ndeal of help to complete this activity, you may want to structure group size so they can have more \nfocused adult support throughout the Community Research Guide.\nGetting Started\nWe recommend you give the young people you work with the Student Letter to read. You may also \nfind it useful to read through each part of the Community Research Guide in its entirety before \nbeginning that part. We suggest you encourage your learners to be excited about this new learning \nadventure. Be prepared to be enthusiastic about their ideas.\nAbout the Guide\nBiotechnology!    Student Letter – Page xvi    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nStudent Letter\nDear Student,\nThis is the last time you will be called a student in this Community Research Guide. \nInstead, you will take on a new role as an action researcher. Action researchers are \ninterested in figuring out what to do to make their communities better. They use \nscientific investigations to help understand the natural world around them. They use \nsocial science investigations to help understand the people, cultures, and history of \ntheir communities. Then they use the information they gather to help solve problems \nin their own communities. This guide will help you learn more about this process. The \nmost important thing to know is that you will control your own research and make \nyour own decisions.\nThink back to a time when you solved a problem. You first needed to know what you \nwanted—your goal. Then you needed to figure out what you needed to do to achieve \nyour goal. This guide is similar. You will think about goals you have for your local \ncommunity, then figure out what you need to take action to help reach those goals.\nYou and your classmates will work as a team to think about information you already \nhave about the place where you live. Then you will investigate your local community \nand how things work. Finally, your team will decide how to make things better. \nTogether, you will put your decision into action. Sometimes making decisions about \nwhat to do is difficult. Don’t worry, this guide will give you lots of support. \nHow to Use this Guide\nThis guide is designed to help you explore and think about problems in your \ncommunity. The guide is here to help you. That means you can always change it.\nAdapting the Guide\nYou will notice that in this guide there are often suggestions about different ways of \nsharing your ideas or doing investigations. This is because different people think and \nwork best in different ways. For example, some people like to draw, some people like \nto talk out loud, and some people prefer to write to express their ideas. This guide has \nsuggestions, but you can always change the method suggested. You can share your \nStudent Letter\nBiotechnology!    Student Letter – Page xvii    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nideas using discussions, acting, signing, telling stories, recording your voice, writing by \nhand, typing on a computer, drawing, or another way you choose. Think about the way \nyou and your team learn best together. Including everyone on the team is important.\nSafety Tips\nThis guide asks you to do and think about things that may seem unfamiliar. You will \nnotice physical and emotional safety tips in the guide. These will help you stay safe and \nsupported during the activities. Make sure you follow your teacher’s directions about \nstaying safe.\nGuide Structure\nThere are eight parts in this guide. Most parts have two tasks. Each task has three \nactivities. The activities are called Discover, Understand, and Act. In the Discover \nactivities you will focus on thinking about information you and your team already \nknow. In the Understand activities you will investigate to find out new information. \nIn the Act activities you will put your existing and new knowledge into action by \napplying it and making decisions. Words that may be unfamiliar will be in bold the first \ntime they are used. Then at the end of each part a glossary lists the definitions of these \nwords.\nInvestigations\nYou are the one doing the research in this guide. This means often you will develop \nyour own questions and determine the best way to answer them. Developing and \nanswering questions is how scientists find out new information about the world \naround them. As an action researcher, you need to think like a scientist to discover \nwhat you need to know, investigate to find out more information, and think about the \nmeaning of what you found out.\nKeeping Organized\nIn this guide you will have some papers you will need to keep so you can look at them \nlater. You may want to have a folder, notebook, or science journal to help you stay \norganized.\nStudent Letter\nBiotechnology!    Student Letter – Page xviii    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nTeams\nYou will be working with other classmates as part of a research team. Your team will \nconduct investigations and make decisions together. When conducting research, there \nmay be many things to figure out as a team. You will need to be creative. There will not \nalways be a clear right and wrong answer. Sometimes the team might not agree. This \nis okay. Just make sure to respect your teammates. There is no one right answer to the \nproblems faced by your community. There is just the right answer for you and your \nteam. \nGetting Started\nYou will be thinking about complex problems. Sometimes this can feel difficult. Be \npatient. You will be guided to consider different parts of the problem. By the time \nyou are making big decisions, you should have lots of information. Always remember, \nyour work is important. Decisions you make can change your community. You are an \nimportant part of making your local and global communities better.\nThank you for working to make your community better.\nThe Smithsonian Science for Global Goals team\nSmithsonian Science Education Center\nSmithsonian Institution\nStudent Letter\nBIOTECHNOLOGY!\nPart 1: Introduction to Biotechnology\ndeveloped by\nSmithsonian\nScience Education Center\nin collaboration with\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 2    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nCopyright Notice\n© 2022 Smithsonian Institution\nAll rights reserved.

How can we ethically  \ncreate a sustainable future for all  \nusing biotechnology?\nBiotechnology can be an important tool to help reach a sustainable future for \nourselves and our planet, but there are also risks and concerns. In this guide you will \nlearn more about the potential of biotechnology while considering your ideas about \nthe best way to navigate those risks and concerns. \nWhile using the guide you will become an action researcher to identify and help \nsolve problems in your community. Action researchers first discover their own existing \nknowledge, then they investigate to understand problems, and finally they act on \nwhat they have learned to make local and global communities better.\nYou will create and keep several sheets of paper or digital documents to help you \nrecord and remember information. You may want to use a notebook or folder to help \norganize the sheets you will use in the guide. \nRemember: In this guide you and your team are in charge. You can always change the \ninstructions in the steps to make them work better for you and your team.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 7    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\nTask 1: What is a sustainable future? \nWho we are affects the way we think about and view the world around us. In this \ntask you will first discover more about your own identity and perspectives about the \nfuture. Then you will understand more about biotechnology and related knowledge \nand perspectives of your community. Finally, you will act to decide what you want to \ninvestigate and think about further.\nDiscover: What is my identity and what are my hopes for the future?\nOur different experiences, backgrounds, and ideas give each of us a unique identity. \nYour identity is what makes you you. Our different identities often lead to different \nperspectives. Perspectives are the way we think about the world around us. \nUnderstanding your own identity and perspectives can help you understand other \nperspectives. This activity will help you think about your own identity.\n\t 1. Take out a piece of paper and title it “Identity Map.” If you prefer, you can make an \nidentity map using objects or digital tools. There are more details about how to do \nthat in step 6. \n\t 2. On the paper, write your name in the center of the page or draw a small picture of \nyourself.\n\t 3. Draw a circle around your name or picture. \n\t 4. Answer the question, “Who am I?” or, “What describes me?” The list below can give \nyou some ideas to consider, but you choose what you want to include. You can \nalso include things that are not on the list. Record anything you can think of that is \nimportant to who you are. \n• Age\n• School or class\n• Race and/or ethnicity\n• Gender\n• Country or place where you live\n• Country or place that is important to you or your family\n• Ideas or beliefs that are important to you\n• Topics or subjects that interest you\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 8    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\n• Hobbies or things you like to do for fun\n• Physical traits (such as tall, black hair, blue eyes, wears glasses)\n• Personality traits (such as loud, funny, sad, kind)\n• Roles you have in your household (such as big sister, helper, cousin)\n• Groups you belong to\n\t 5. Write each answer on the page around your name. Draw a line between your \nname and each answer. Figure 1-1 is an example of a written identity map. You can \nput your answers at the end of each line. \nFigure 1-1: Example of a written identity map.\n\t 6. If you prefer, you can use objects around your home or class to create your map. \nTo keep your map, you can take a picture or just remember it. Figure 1-2 is an \nexample of an identity map using objects. You could also make a digital map using \nrecordings or photos.\nFigure 1-2: Example of an identity map using objects.\n\t 7. Now form a team. As action researchers you will work together with your team, made \nup of your classmates, for the rest of this guide. You will work together to understand \nyour local area and make it better. Your team may be your whole class, or it may be a \nsmaller group. Either is fine.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 9    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\n\t 8. Share your Identity Map with the members of your team to find out what you have \nin common. Try to find matching identities with your teammates. For example, if \nyou like to read for fun, see if you can find someone else who likes to read for fun. \nFind a few matching identities. Then move on to the next step.\n Emotional Safety Tip\nSharing your identity with someone else can help build trust between \nyou and that person. But it can be hard to share your personal identity \nwith someone else. Only share parts of your Identity Map that you feel \ncomfortable talking about.\n\t 9. Now try to find teammates who have different identities from you. Find a few \npeople who have different identities. Then return to your place. \n\t\nThink quietly to yourself about the different identities you found in your team. \nEveryone on your team is unique. Having a team that includes people with \ndifferent identities means everyone has different information to share and \ndifferent perspectives. As action researchers, you will work together as a team \nto find the best way to take action on the problems you identify. The different \nidentities and experiences of each member of your team will help you make better \ndecisions. For example, if you were born in the place where you live now but your \nteammate was born somewhere else, you each may know different things, which \nleads to different perspectives. \n\t\nRead Our Identities, Our Perspectives, Our Future.\nOur Identities, Our Perspectives, Our Future\nDifferent people may have different perspectives on what they want the future \nto be like. Sometimes these perspectives are related to identities or personal \nexperiences. Our identities can affect what we know about or what we think is \nimportant.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 10    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\nIf there is something that is important to you now, you may want it to be part of \nyour future. For example, maybe on your Identity Map you said you liked being \noutside. Then you might want easy access to the outdoors as part of your future. \nOften books, films, or other media present ideas about what could happen in the \nfuture. These ideas can also help you imagine what kind of future you would want \nor not want. \nIn this guide you will be thinking about how you believe biotechnology can be \na part of a sustainable future. But first you must think about what a sustainable \nfuture is. \nAn approach that balances different perspectives and can keep working for a \nlong time is called sustainable. A sustainable future balances social, economic, \nenvironmental, and ethical concerns in a way that works well for people and the \nplanet. \nYour perspective about what a sustainable future should include is valuable. Other \npeople may have different perspectives. Their perspectives are also valuable. \nThinking about all these different perspectives together can help you envision a \nsustainable future that works for everyone, not just you.\n\t\nThink quietly to yourself about what you want a sustainable future to include. You \ncan use your own original ideas or ideas from other places. Use ideas from your \nexperiences, books, movies, or other media, or conversations you have had to help \nyou think about these questions.\n\t a. How would you want the future to be different than life now?\n\t b. Are there things you would like to remain the same?\n\t13. Now take a piece of paper or open a digital document and divide it into two \nsections. Label one section “Hopes” and the other “Concerns.” \n\t\nIn the Hopes section record your ideas by writing, drawing, or using digital images \nto represent your hopes for the future for you, your area, the people around you, \nand the whole world. Do not feel like your ideas have to be possible today—dream \nbig! \nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 11    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\n\t\nAs you think about your hopes for a sustainable future, you may also start to think \nabout things that concern or worry you about the future. Record these ideas in the \nConcerns section. \n Emotional Safety Tip\nWhen thinking about the future it is okay to be worried or concerned. \nThese feelings are natural, especially when the future feels uncertain. \nBy thinking about your fears, you can make choices to try to make sure \nyour fears don’t happen.\n\t\nLabel a class board, a large piece of poster paper, or a shared digital document \n“Futures Mood Board.” A mood board is a tool to help gather ideas, concepts, and \nstyles to design something. In this case, you are designing the future. \n\t a. On one half of the mood board write “Hopes.” Fill this half with words, \ndrawings, pictures, or other ways to represent each person’s hopes for a \nsustainable future.\n\t b. On the other half of the mood board write “Concerns.” Fill this half with words, \ndrawings, pictures, or other ways to represent each person’s worries, fears, or \nconcerns about the future for people and the planet.\n Emotional Safety Tip\nSometimes you may want to keep hopes and concerns for the future \nprivate. Only share what you feel comfortable sharing.\n\t\nExamine your Futures Mood Board.\n\t a. Do you notice things that surprise you about the hopes and concerns of your \nother team members?\n\t b. Do you notice any hopes and concerns that you have in common? \n\t\nRead Guidelines for Team Discussion.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 12    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\n Guidelines for Team Discussion\n• Remember, listening to many different perspectives and viewpoints is good.\n• Open yourself to new ideas.\n• Differences in your team can be useful. People with different identities can bring \nnew knowledge and ideas.\n• Be an active listener by facing the person and show them you are paying \nattention.\n• Be respectful and expect respect. People may have different ideas, and that \ndoes not mean their ideas are wrong. Creating a team where all ideas are \nwelcome is an important step toward making sustainable decisions.\n Emotional Safety Tip\nSometimes your team members may have different perspectives than \nyou. That’s okay. Listen respectfully but remember that just because \nsomeone else believes something does not mean you need to believe it. \nIt is okay to pause a conversation if you are uncomfortable or upset.\n\t19. As a team, discuss:\n\t a. Do you think a person with a different identity, like someone from somewhere \nelse or who is much older, might have different hopes and concerns about the \nfuture?\n\t b. If so, why might it be important to include those ideas about the future when \nthinking about a sustainable future?\nUnderstand: What does my community know and think about the future and  \nbiotechnology?\nAs an action researcher on the future and biotechnology, one of your jobs is to find out \nmore about what other people in your community think about the future and how \nbiotechnology might help create a sustainable future. Understanding perspectives in \nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 13    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\nyour community can be an important part of considering what is sustainable and what \nactions you want to take. Helping your community starts by considering who is in the \ncommunity and how they feel. You can investigate this using a survey. \n\t 1. First consider which community you want to focus on. A community is a group \nof people who share something, for example, your family, your classmates, your \nteachers, or your neighbors. A community can share space, like a local, national, or \nglobal community. Or a community can share an identity, like a religion, ethnicity, \nor common interest. If you think back to your identity map, you will probably \nrealize you are part of many communities. Which community’s perspective on \nbiotechnology and the future would you like to understand? Discuss with your \nteam and decide on a community you all belong to.\n\t 2. With your team, consider what would be important to know about the hopes \nand concerns your community has for the future. Write down a few questions you \nmight like to ask.\n\t 3. Read What Is Biotechnology? and think quietly to yourself whether there are any \nways you might use biotechnology in your life right now.\nWhat Is Biotechnology?\nBiotechnology is using living things, parts of living things, or things produced \nby living things to meet people’s needs and improve their lives. It includes using \nparts of cells, whole organisms, or even ecosystems to meet our needs. It also \nincludes making changes to parts of cells, organisms, or ecosystems to make them \nbetter fit people’s needs. \n\t 4. In this guide you will be thinking about biotechnology and the future. You may \nwant to start by asking people in your community general questions about the \nfuture to help you understand their perspectives, hopes, and concerns. Remember \nwhat you thought about that was related to your future hopes and concerns. Write \ndown any questions you might want to ask your community. For example:\n\t a. What will be most important for our community in the future?\n\t b. What is the biggest threat to our community in the future? \nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 14    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\n\t 5. You may also want to ask questions related specifically to biotechnology. Write \ndown any questions you might want to ask. For example:\n\t a. What do you think biotechnology means?\n\t b. Are there things that excite you about biotechnology in the future?\n\t c. Are there things that scare you about biotechnology in the future?\n\t d. Or any other questions you would like to ask.\n\t 6. Read the Survey Instructions for more information about how to give a survey and \npick your questions.\nSurvey Instructions\nYou can use a survey to understand the people in your community better. \nA survey is a list of simple questions you can ask of a group of people. \nChoosing people to survey \n\t a. Think about the categories in your identity map. Use those categories to try \nto pick a diverse group of people to survey, to get a more accurate idea of \nwhat your community thinks and feels. For example, you may want to survey \npeople of many different ages or of more than one gender. \nWays you could give a survey\n\t a. Talk to people in person, on the phone, or using a virtual meeting. \n\t b. Have people answer questions using paper, email, or an online survey. \n\t c. Collect responses using a social media post.\nPicking questions\n\t a. Consider open-ended or close-ended questions. An example of an open-ended \nquestion is, “What would be part of a sustainable future?” An example of a  \nclose-ended question is, “Is limiting global temperature rise part of a sustainable \nfuture?” You usually can get more information from an open-ended question, \nbut if you have a lot of answers, it can be difficult to keep track of all the \ndifferent ideas. Using a close-ended question is quicker, but you may miss some \nideas from your community.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 15    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\n\t b. Try to make your questions neutral. That means you are not trying to put \nyour opinion in the question. For example, “Do you agree that biotechnology \nshould be used to help create a sustainable future?” would not be neutral. The \nperson answering the question might assume you want them to answer “yes.” \nA more neutral question might be, “Do you think biotechnology can be part of \na sustainable future?”\nTips for giving a survey\n\t a. Make sure your questions are easy to understand and specific, such as, \n“What worries you about the future?” instead of, “What worries you?”\n\t b. Think about the best method for the survey. Is there a safe and easy way to \ngather the opinions of a wide variety of people in your community?\n\t c. Think about the best way to survey your community. For example, does \neveryone have access to the Internet if you want to do an online survey?\n\t d. Some people you survey may not be familiar with the meaning of biotechnology. \nYou may want to start off by sharing the definition of biotechnology with them \nbefore you start asking questions about biotechnology. For example, you might \nsay, “Biotechnology is using living things or parts of living things to meet people’s \nneeds. Biotechnology can be used in lots of different ways, like to make different \ntypes of plants to eat or create new medicines.”\nSafety tips for giving a survey\nTalk to your teacher or a trusted adult for guidelines. They will know what is safest \nin your community. \n Physical Safety Tip\nNever go out alone and always be aware of your surroundings. Pay \nattention to local guidance on whether it is safe to interact with people \noutside of your home.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 16    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\n Emotional Safety Tip\nIt can be hard to talk to other people in the community. You may feel \nshy or nervous. Someone may tell you they don’t want to talk. That’s \nokay! It doesn’t have anything to do with you. It just means they don’t \nwant to share. You can show them respect by thanking them and moving \non to another community member.\n\t 7. Examine the questions you listed and choose the questions you want to ask your \ncommunity. You probably want to ask between five and ten questions in your \nsurvey. You may want a mix of close-ended and open-ended questions. \n\t 8. Decide on your survey methods, and choose where, who, and how you will \nconduct your survey. \n\t 9. Remember, including everyone is important. If you are working with a team, \nyou may need to adjust the way you do your survey so that everyone feels safe, \ncomfortable, and able to help. Those changes are okay! They are part of including \neveryone. Make sure to consider:\n\t a. Time: If the survey happens after school, does everyone in the team have time \nto do it?\n\t b. Comfort: If you decide to move around the community to do your survey, \nmake sure everyone on your team feels safe and able to do this. If not, what is \nanother way team members could help with the survey? \n\t c. Location: If the survey is going to happen in a specific place, how easy is it for \nteam members to get to that place?\n\t\nIf you are working with a team, assign different jobs to people. For example, if you \ndecide to do an online survey, decide who will type the survey, who will share it, \nand who will collect the results. \n\t\nFinally, conduct your survey by yourself or with your team and record the results.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 17    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\nAct: How does biotechnology relate to a sustainable future for my local and \nglobal community?\nYou asked your community about their hopes and concerns about the future and \nbiotechnology. Now you can apply what you have learned to think more about the \nfuture your community wants and how that relates to a global future.\n\t 1.  Take out your Futures Mood Board and examine the results of your survey. Are \nthere hopes and concerns others in your community shared that are not yet part \nof your mood board? If so, add those ideas now.\n\t 2. \tWith your team, use your mood board to discuss important goals for a sustainable \nfuture. These goals might be based on your hopes, like “everyone has access to \nclean energy” or they might be based on your concerns, like “no more extinction of \nanimals.”\n\t 3.  Read The United Nations and the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe United Nations and the Sustainable Development Goals \nAchieving a sustainable future like the one you just thought about is complex. \nIt takes many people working together in many places to create a sustainable \nfuture. When many people are working together it helps to have someone \norganizing. The United Nations, also called the UN, is a global organization \ndesigned to help governments and people around the world collaborate. \nA few years ago, the UN asked countries and people around the world to imagine \na better world and a better future. They worked together to determine a list of \ngoals. Then the countries of the UN came to consensus on the most important \ngoals needed to get to a better world. These goals for the global community are \ncalled the UN Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 18    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 1\nFigure 1-3: United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\t 4. \tExamine the different SDGs. Are there SDGs you think are important for a \nsustainable future that your team didn’t discuss? Do you think those goals are also \nimportant? If so, add those ideas to your Futures Mood Board.\n\t 5. \tParts 2 through 7 of this guide will help you explore how biotechnology can \nbe a part of a sustainable future in different ways. Each of these parts will show \nthe possibilities of using biotechnology and will support you to think about the \nrisks. You and your team will try to balance these ideas and determine when \nbiotechnology should be used. Parts 2 through 7 are about:\n\t a. Part 2: Biotechnology and Food Systems: Exploring how biotechnology can \nand should help create an equitable, sustainable agriculture and food system.\n\t b.

Biodiversity loss is a decrease in \nthe variety of the many different living things on Earth.\n\t f. Part 7: Biotechnology and Security: Investigating when you can and should \nuse biotechnology to make your world more secure.\n\t 6.  Figure out how much time you have to complete the parts of this guide. For \nexample, your teacher may say you only have time to do one part, just a few parts, \nor maybe all of them.\n\t 7. \tIf you do not have time for all the parts, discuss with your team and pick the parts \nthat are most closely related to hopes or concerns from your Futures Mood Board. \nAfter the next task, you can start working on the parts you have picked.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 20    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nTask 2: How can biotechnology help create a sustainable \nfuture? \nBiotechnology is rapidly changing the things people can do or even imagine doing. In \nthis task you will discover ways you are already using biotechnology and think more \nabout how it could be used in the future. You will investigate to understand more \nabout new tools in biotechnology and how they can be used. Then you will act on this \ninformation to start thinking about ethics and how biotechnology should be used.\nDiscover: How do I use biotechnology now and how could I use it in the future?\nTechnology is the materials and methods used to solve people’s problems and meet \ntheir needs. For example, a long time ago people developed the method of using \ndifferent materials to create wheels, which helped solve a transportation problem. \nWheels are an example of technology. Biotechnology is using living things, parts of \nliving things, or things produced by living things to solve people’s problems and meet \ntheir needs. Although new biotechnologies are being developed every day, there are \nways people have used biotechnology for thousands of years. We will start this activity \nby thinking about biotechnology in your life.\n\t 1.  Think quietly to yourself. What do you think of when you think about a living \nthing? The first thing many people think of is an animal. Do you think animals have \nbeen changed over time to better meet human needs? Discuss your ideas with \nyour team.\n\t 2.  Read Domestication and Selective Breeding to find out more.\nDomestication and Selective Breeding\nWithin any species, or specific type of living thing, there is a lot of variation, or \ndifferences. For example, think of the differences in the way people appear, their \nabilities, the behaviors they have, and the things that interest them.\nEven before they understood how the process worked, people noticed the fact of \ninheritance—that some traits or characteristics of parents were often passed on \nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 21    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nto their children, or offspring. Inheritance occurs in humans and in other living \nthings. For example, the offspring of a fast-running horse is likely to be a fast \nrunner. The offspring of a sheep that has very fine wool is likely to have fine wool. \nAnimals that are friendly to humans are more likely to have offspring that will be \nfriendly to humans. \nThousands of years ago people began to use the idea of inheritance to \ndomesticate animals, which is the process of changing a species from its wild \nstate to make it more useful for a specific purpose. People would breed two \nanimals that had traits they wanted to encourage, in the hope that their offspring \nwould have the same traits. This process is known as selective breeding.\nFigure 1-4: Gray wolf.\nThe first domesticated animal was the dog. Its wild ancestor was closer to a wolf, \nbut people used selective breeding and the resulting new species was friendlier \nto humans and could be used as a hunting assistant. Many other animal and plant \nspecies were domesticated over time, often developing traits quite different from \ntheir wild ancestors. Even within a domesticated species, humans have selectively \nbred plants and animals for different traits, such as size, color, or the ability to run \nlong distances. Dogs are a good example of the wide diversity created by selective \nbreeding within a species.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 22    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n\t 3.  Discuss with your team. What domesticated animals are you familiar with? List \nanimals that people use as companions, as food, to produce products like milk or \nwool, or for labor, like carrying people or pulling loads. For each animal you list, try \nto think of what traits people may have been selecting for as they domesticated \nthe animal. Write your answers on a class board or just discuss.\n\t 4. \tWith your team, consider the pictures in Figure 1-6. Sometimes within one species \n(such as a cow) people have chosen different traits to select for. This results in \ndifferent breeds or types within the species. In Figure 1-6, one of the cows is used \nto produce milk to sell. The other is used for its meat. \n\t a. What traits do you notice that are different between the two cows? \n\t b. Which traits might be important for milk or meat production?\n\t c. Which cow do you think is used to produce milk?\nFigure 1-5 Variety of dogs.\nDomestication and selective breeding are examples of biotechnology. Selective \nbreeding produced many of the differences among the dogs shown in Figure 1-5.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 23    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n\t 5.  Examine the pictures in Figure 1-7. People have domesticated plants using \nselective breeding. Often, they tried to change wild plants so they produce more \nof their edible or desirable part, and are easier to grow and easier to harvest. Try to \nmatch the domesticated plant on the top with its wild ancestor on the bottom.\nFigure 1-6: Dairy cow (left) and beef cow (right).\nFigure 1-7: Domesticated plants and their wild ancestors.\n\t 6.  Compare your answers with the ones listed below. How did you choose which \nones to match? What do you notice about changes to each plant during \ndomestication?\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 24    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n\t a. Carrots match with Queen Anne’s lace.\n\t b. Rice matches with rufipogon.\n\t c. Corn/maize matches with teosinte.\n\t 7.  Examine the wild cabbage plant in Figure 1-8. Just like animal breeders, plant \nbreeders sometimes focus on specific parts of the plant to change. Which part do \nyou think breeders selected for to produce the edible vegetables shown in Figure \n1-9? Match each wild cabbage part to a specific vegetable.\nFigure 1-8: Wild cabbage plant.\nFigure 1-9: Cauliflower, cabbage, kohlrabi, kale, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli (left to right).\n\t 8.  Check your answers.\n\t a. Selecting for the flower buds created cauliflower.\n\t b. Selecting for the terminal leaf buds created cabbage.\n\t c. Selecting for the stem created kohlrabi.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 25    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n\t d. Selecting for the leaf created kale.\n\t e. Selecting for the lateral leaf buds created Brussels sprouts.\n\t f. Selecting for the flower buds and stems created broccoli.\n\t 9.  Discuss with your team the way people use plants in addition to eating them, such \nas using them for clothing or building materials. Do you think people may have \nalso used selective breeding to domesticate plants used in those ways?\n\t10.  In addition to plants and animals, did you know that people around the world \noften eat living things that are too small to see, called microorganisms? Discuss \nwith your team. Do you think you eat any foods with microorganisms in them?\n\t\nRead Microorganisms and Food Preparation to find out more.\nMicroorganisms and Food Preparation\nPeople have been making bread and producing beer for thousands of years. \nWhat do these two processes have in common? They both use a microorganism, \nyeast, to create something to eat or drink. In baked goods like breads, yeast eats \nthe carbohydrates (flours and sugars) in the bread dough and produces carbon \ndioxide gas. This carbon dioxide gas gets trapped in the bread dough and causes \nit to rise. When making beer, yeast eats the carbohydrates (sugars) in grain and \nproduces carbon dioxide gas, which causes the beer bubbles, and alcohol.\nFigure 1-10: Rising bread dough and baked bread.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 26    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nFermentation is a food preparation technique that adds microorganisms to \nfood or encourages naturally occurring microorganisms to develop. Fermenting \nmicroorganisms eat carbohydrates and usually produce gases like carbon dioxide, \nacids, and/or alcohols. Many different types of food are the result of fermentation. \nOften more than one type of microorganism is part of the process. Fungi, like \nyeasts and molds, and different types of helpful bacteria are used to ferment foods \nand drinks in many places around the world. \nFor example, specific bacteria added to milk produces yogurt and cheese. \nSome cheeses also have types of molds added to them. Sometimes grains are \nfermented, like for sourdough bread or injera. Fermented vegetable and fruit \nproducts such as kimchi, miso, sauerkraut, chicha morada, and vinegar are \ncommon in many places. \nFigure 1-11: Examples of fermented foods: kimchi, pickled cabbage,  \nmiso soup (top, left to right), yogurt, fermented pickles, sauerkraut (bottom, left to right).\nFermenting food often makes it easier to digest and introduces helpful \nbacteria to your digestive system. Fermentation can also preserve food. Using \nmicroorganisms in food preparation is an example of biotechnology. If you are \ninterested in learning more about biotechnology and food, you can visit the \nBiotechnology! StoryMap to link to the Smithsonian’s community research guide \nFood!.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 27    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n\t\nWith your team, list any ways you can think of that fermentation is used to \nproduce things to eat and drink in your community. You may never have realized \nbefore that a food or drink was fermented, so here are some identification clues:\n\t a. How does it taste? Food with microorganisms often tastes yeasty, sour (from \nthe acid produced), or alcoholic (from the alcohol produced).\n\t b. Are there bubbles created during the preparation? Bubbles can be a sign that \ngases are being produced by microorganisms. Think carefully, though, not \nall food or drink that is bubbly uses fermentation. For example, sodas have \ncarbon dioxide added by the producers to create the bubbles.\n\t c. Is the food or drink mixed and then left to sit for a while? Microorganisms \nneed time to grow. Fermented foods and drinks often are left to develop \nanywhere from a few hours to many years!\n\t d. Does the food or drink use cultures or starters in the process? Cultures and \nstarters often contain the microorganisms needed to start fermentation.\n\t\n\tThink quietly to yourself about how biotechnologies such as domestication, \nselective breeding, and fermentation have affected you and your life. How do you \nthink human history would be different without the ways people have used and \nchanged animals, plants, and microorganisms?\n\t\nThink of a story about the impact on you of something produced using \nbiotechnology—for example, the story of a pet, a favorite food, or plants you are \nfamiliar with. Share this story with a partner, your team, or write or draw it.\nUnderstand: What are some of the genetic tools of biotechnology?\nDomestication and selective breeding rely on the idea that offspring inherit traits from \ntheir parents. For many years, although people understood this idea of inheritance \nfrom parents, they didn’t know how it worked. Finally, they realized genetic data is \npassed from parent to offspring. Genetic data is a set of instructions in each cell about \nhow to build and maintain a living thing. Living things with a mother and a father \nreceive a copy of the genetic data from both parents. However, it was not until the \n1950s that scientists discovered the structure of the genetic data. A molecule, known \nas DNA, transfers and stores genetic data. \nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 28    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nDiscovering and understanding the structure of DNA changed biotechnology forever. \nIt provided a new way to understand living things. Researchers also learned that by \nchanging DNA, scientists could change the genetic data and traits of living things. \nBecause DNA is so important to biotechnology, in this activity you will learn more \nabout its structure and how it works. This will help you complete the rest of the guide.\n\t 1.  Think quietly to yourself about these questions. \n\t a. What things around you do you think have DNA? \n\t b. What could you learn or do if you had access to that DNA?\n\t 2.  Read DNA Extraction Instructions and carry out a DNA extraction.\nDNA Extraction Instructions\nDNA contains a huge amount of information and it is found in every living thing. \nBreaking cells apart and pulling something out, or extracting the DNA is often \nthe first step in biotechnology research and applications. In this experiment, you \nwill complete a DNA extraction yourself.\nWhat you will need\n• Alcohol: At least 70% concentration of rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol or ethanol. \nYou can buy this at a chemist, drugstore, or places where first aid items are sold. \nDo NOT use alcoholic beverages; the experiment will not work.\n• DNA source: You can choose your source—strawberries, bananas, peas (fresh, \ndried, or frozen) all work well, as do many fruits and seeds. Choose something \nthat is easily available for you.\n• Containers: A plastic bag, a bowl, or a cup. You will use this to hold the DNA \nsource while you are mashing it. You’ll also need another container to mix some \ningredients.\n• Fork or spoon: To mash your DNA source.\n• Water: Use any clean water you have available.\n• Salt: Everyday cooking salt is fine.\n• Detergent: Dish soap or shampoo both work well.\n• Filter: Any coffee filter will do. If one is not available you can use a paper towel, \na very fine sieve, or even an old T-shirt.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 29    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n• Clear container: A glass or plastic cup works best, but you can use a bowl if that \nis what you have.\n• Skewer or toothpick\nDirections\n\t a. 1 over 2\n\t b. Put your DNA source in a container and mash or grind it so it forms a paste. \nYou need about 100 ml (1/2 cup) of the DNA source. You can place it in a \nplastic bag, like in Figure 1-12, or put it in a bowl or cup and use a fork or \nspoon to mash it. This process breaks up the cell walls in the plants.\nFigure 1-12: Smashed strawberries in a plastic bag.\n\t c. In another cup or bowl combine around 100 ml (1/2 cup) water, 5 g \n(1 teaspoon) salt, and 10 ml (2 teaspoons) detergent. Mix thoroughly.\nFigure 1-13: Salt, water, and detergent mixture.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 30    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nGenome: The complete sequence of DNA of a living thing\nIdentity: The characteristics that make you you\nInheritance: The process in which traits or characteristics of parents are passed on to \ntheir children\n\t d. Add about 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of this water mixture to your mashed-up DNA \nsource. Mix gently. The detergent will help break up the lipids (fats) in the cell \nmembranes and release the DNA. The salt helps make the DNA easier to extract.\n\t e. Strain the mixture through the filter into the clear container.\nFigure 1-14: Filtering the strawberry mixture.\n\t f. Take your alcohol out of the freezer and pour it gently down the side of your \nclear container. Pour about as much alcohol as you have DNA source mixture.\n\t g. Watch carefully. The alcohol will sit in a layer on top of your DNA source \nmixture. However, DNA will begin to precipitate, or come out of solution, in \nthe alcohol. Cloudy white wisps will start to appear in the alcohol as the DNA \nprecipitates. Let your mixture sit for 5 to 15 minutes to get the most DNA.\n\t h. You can twirl a skewer or toothpick in the alcohol layer to pick up the DNA. It \nwill be sticky and a little slimy. This visible substance is the DNA from many \ncells that is stuck together.\nFigure 1-15: Toothpick showing DNA extracted from strawberries.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 31    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nGoing further\nNow that you have extracted the DNA from one source, try another source. DNA \nis part of every living thing. However, it can be tricky to extract it from the roots, \nleaves, and stems of plants. You can also extract DNA from animal products, like \nchicken liver. For some things you may need a blender to break up the cells rather \nthan just mashing them by hand.\nYou can extract DNA in everything from seed pods you collect from plants to your \nown saliva (spit)! What can you find around you to use as a DNA source?\n\t 3. \tDiscuss the results of your experiment with your team.\n\t a. Were you able to extract DNA?\n\t b. What do you think you could do with DNA once it is extracted?\n\t 4.  Read DNA: Instructions for Life.\nDNA: Instructions for Life\nThe information in DNA is stored in bases. There are four types of bases: adenine \n(A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The bases form a long sequence \nthat stores information about how to make different proteins.\nEach base type pairs with one other type, so A always pairs with T and C always \npairs with G. These matches are known as base pairs. You may know that DNA is \na double helix molecule. Each side contains a sequence of bases paired with the \nother matching set of base pairs, as shown in Figure 1-16. \nFigure 1-16: Illustration of a double helix with matching base pairs.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 32    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nIf you want to make sure you understand, you can use the sequence here and fill \nin the matching base pairs. The first few matches are done in red for you.\nIn 1990, scientists around the world decided it was important to determine the \nentire human genome, or sequence of DNA, which is around 3 billion base pairs \nin total. Researchers from 20 institutions in six countries worked together as part \nof the Human Genome Project and in 2001 they published the sequence of almost \nthe entire human genome. Researchers continued to improve their knowledge \nand in 2022 filled in the final gaps. The first human genome sequence produced \nin 2001 cost about US$1 billion to produce. Today, sequencing an entire human \ngenome costs less than US$1,000, and the cost continues to go down. \n\t 5. \tDiscuss with your team:\n\t a. Why do you think it was useful to sequence the whole human genome?\n\t b. The genomes of different humans are 99.9% the same. Why do you think there \nis still a need to sequence individual human genomes?\n\t c. Researchers have also been sequencing the genomes of other living things. \nWhat might they hope to learn from that information?\n\t 6.  Read Gene Expression and Variation.\nGene Expression and Variation\nYou know that genetic data is carried by the molecule DNA and copies of a \nparents’ DNA are given to their offspring. But how does this genetic data create \ndifferent traits? Long strands of DNA are organized into smaller sections called \ngenes. Genes can be copied and used by a cell to produce proteins. Cells “read” \nthe sequence of bases pairs in a gene to find out how to form a specific protein. \nProducing these proteins is called gene expression. \nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 33    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nGenes code for specific proteins that create specific traits. Some traits, like \nwhether a person has a detached earlobe or can roll their tongue, are determined \nby a single gene. Other traits, such as a person’s height and skin color, are \ndetermined by multiple genes.\nEven small changes in the sequence of the base pairs in a gene can create big \nchanges in the protein.\nLet’s use an analogy to explain. Imagine rather than the four letters (a, c, g, and t)  \nrepresenting the bases of DNA, the DNA instructions used the letters of the \nalphabet to share information. \nTake out a piece of paper and something to write with. You will model a cell \n“reading” a gene of its DNA. For each bolded sentence, follow the instructions. \nIn this analogy an initial gene might be read like this:\nStart here: Read this sentence then draw a box.\nAs part of the model analogy, you probably just drew a box.\nHowever, sometimes when DNA is copied the cell might make a mistake and copy \none letter wrong. Genes with one or more differences like that are called variants. \nIn this analogy, the mistake might be quite small but will change the meaning. \nFollow the instructions in the sentence below. \nStart here: Read this sentence and then draw a fox.\nHow is what you drew this time different? In the example, the “b” from box \nchanged to an “f” which changed the meaning of the sentence. \nSometimes small changes like this do not create a problem. However, sometimes \nthey can mean the person with the variant is unable to make a certain protein \nproperly. Diseases like Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia are caused \nby variants like this. \nIn the past, once a problematic variant occurred, there was no way to fix it. \nHowever, in 2012 scientists began using a new biotechnology tool called   \nCRISPR-Cas9. CRISPR is sometimes called “DNA scissors” because it can snip DNA \nin very specific places to add, delete, or change base pair sequences. \nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 34    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nFigure 1-17: Illustration of CRISPR-Cas9, sometimes known as DNA scissors.\nThe development of these techniques means it is easier than ever before for \npeople to change genes in very specific ways—a process called gene editing. For \nexample, in this analogy, by using CRISPR the word “fox” could be changed back to \nthe original word “box.” \nOr by using CRISPR, new instructions could be added. Continue modeling a cell \nreading a gene and follow the instructions below:\nStart here: Read this sentence and then draw a box and a rainbow.\nOr by using CRISPR, scientists can take a piece of the gene out. Here’s an example \nof that using the sentence analogy. Follow the instructions in the bold sentence.\nStart here: Read this sentence.\nOr by using CRISPR, scientists can take a piece of the gene out and replace it with \nanother base pair sequence. Follow the instructions in the bold sentence to model \nan example of that.\nStart here: Read this sentence and then think of a box.\nOr by using CRISPR or other techniques, scientists can stop genes from being \nexpressed. This is called gene silencing. Follow the instructions in the bold \nsentence to model an example of that.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 35    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nStop here: Read this sentence and then draw a box.\nExamine what you drew on your paper. Did you get different instructions after the \ngene was edited? \nCRISPR and other similar gene editing tools mean it is possible to change specific \nparts of the genome of any living thing. \nUsing gene editing tools, gene expression can change in many ways. By changing \nthe DNA in genes, the proteins they code for can be changed. Mistakes in gene \ncopying can be fixed and new instructions can be added. Using gene silencing, a \ngene that is causing a problem can be “turned off.” \nIf you would like more information about how gene expression and editing works \nwithin a cell, you can find more resources in the Biotechnology! StoryMap.\nParts 2 through 7 share more details about how gene editing and other \nbiotechnology tools have opened up many new possibilities for human health, \nthe environment, and many other areas.\n\t 7.  Discuss with your team: \n\t a. Can you think of a specific way or ways a gene editing tool could be used to \nhelp people or the planet?\n\t b. If you can’t, don’t worry, you will be learning more during the rest of the guide.\nAct: What concerns do I have about using biotechnology sustainably?\nBiotechnology tools can change the world around us in dramatic ways. However, just \nbecause things can be done does not mean they should be done. In this activity you \nwill start to consider how and when you think biotechnology should be used.\n\t 1.  As a team, take out a piece of blank paper or use a section of a class board. Divide \nyour paper or the board into four sections and draw a circle in the middle, as \nshown in Figure 1-18. In one section write “Social,” in one write “Economic,” in one \nwrite “Environmental,” and in one write “Ethical.”\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 36    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n\t 2.  Read Different Perspectives and think about what the different perspectives \nmean. Write words or draw pictures within each section of the circle to help you \nremember the concerns of people thinking about each perspective. \nSocial Economic\nEnvironmental Ethical\nFigure 1-18: Perspectives sheet.\nDifferent Perspectives\nPeople may have different perspectives. Often a person’s perspective may be \nrelated to parts of their own identity or experiences.\nConsidering different perspectives can help uncover solutions for a sustainable \nfuture. Sustainable means balancing the needs of different people and other living \nthings over the long term. When thinking about sustainability, it is important to \nconsider four types of perspectives: social, economic, environmental, and ethical.\n• Social is about the interaction of people in a community. The health, education, \nand well-being of people are the most important things from this perspective.\n• Economic is about money, income, and use of wealth. Economic growth, \nincluding making sure people have jobs and enough money, is the most \nimportant thing from this perspective.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 37    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n• Environmental is about the natural world. Protecting the Earth and its natural \nsystems are the most important things from this perspective.\n• Ethical means that something is fair. Doing what is right and having a just \ncommunity where everyone is treated fairly are the most important things from \nthis perspective.\n\t 3. \tNow read the Biotechnology Scenarios. In each section of your Perspectives Sheet, \ndraw pictures or write words that show ways this situation might be helpful from \nthat particular perspective. Also draw or write ways that you think the scenario \nmight concern or worry people thinking from this perspective.\nBiotechnology Scenarios\nScenario 1: A researcher modifies the DNA of a human egg cell by editing a gene \nto makes the cell more resistant to disease.\nScenario 2: Plant biologists use CRISPR to modify the DNA of a rice plant to insert \na gene that makes the plant need less water to grow. Next year they will start to \nuse this modified plant in local farms.\nScenario 3: A gene therapy treatment that inserts new DNA sequences into \ntargeted body cells helps cure a rare disease. The treatment is only available at \na few hospitals and costs US$450,000.\nScenario 4: A company collects and sequences DNA samples, which enables clients \nto better understand their family heritage and risk of specific diseases. This data \ncould potentially be used by employers or insurance companies to make decisions \nabout whether to hire or insure people. However, right now the company’s privacy \npolicy currently states the data will only be used by the company itself.\nScenario 5: A mosquito species carries and infects people with the disease Zika. \nA team of researchers introduces a genetic modification to that species of mosquito. \nThe genetic modification will slowly destroy the population of mosquitoes over time \nby limiting their ability to reproduce. The researchers hope this will stop the spread \nof Zika. The team plans to release the modified mosquito into the wild.\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 38    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\n\t 4.  Examine all the concerns from the Perspectives Sheet with your team. Are there \nspecific themes, or main ideas, that you notice? If so, make a note of these themes.\n\t 5.  Several themes often emerge when thinking about using biotechnology ethically. \nExamine the themes that follow and make a note if they are reflected in some of \nthe things you thought about from a social, economic, environmental, and ethical \nperspective.\n\t a. Access: Who gets to use and benefit from biotechnology?\n\t b. Privacy: What personal data is available and how can it be used?\n\t c. Unbalanced ecosystems: Natural systems are interdependent, which means \ndifferent parts of the system depend on one another. Will the biotechnology \nunbalance the system in an unanticipated way?\n\t d. Persistence: Will the modification remain in the body of a living thing or in \nlarger natural systems? Will the modification spread uncontrollably?\n\t e. Decision-making: Who should get to decide these issues? How do the \ndecisions of one person or group affect others?\n\t f. Safety: What is the potential for harm?\n\t 6.  Discuss with your team which ethical themes you think are most important to \nkeep in mind as you consider whether biotechnologies should be used. \n\t 7.  Pick some or all of the themes listed here, as well as any other themes you think \nare important. Create a list, chart, infographic, piece of artwork, or other method \nto help you remember these themes. Keep this Ethical Concerns List; you will need \nit in other Parts of this guide. If it is a visual reminder, you may want to post it \nsomewhere in your classroom.\n\t 8.  Go back and examine your Futures Mood Board. Think quietly to yourself or share \nwith your team:\n\t a. In your hopes for the future, could some hopes be threatened by the ethical \nthemes you identified?\n\t b. In your concerns about the future, could some concerns become more likely \ndue to the themes you identified?\nBiotechnology!     Part 1 – Page 39    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 1 Task 2\nCongratulations!\nYou have finished Part 1.\nFind out More!\nFor additional resources and activities, please visit the Biotechnology!

But sometimes people do not have access to the food they need or \nwant. In this task you will first discover more about the way food systems work. Then \nyou will investigate different scenarios to understand the way biotechnology might \nchange food systems. Finally, you will use this information to decide how you want to \nact now and in the future.\nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Matin Qaim. Matin (pronounced ma-TEEN) is one of \nthe many researchers around the world thinking about how to \ncreate a sustainable food system.\nMatin is a professor of agricultural economics and director at \nthe Center for Development Research at the University of Bonn, \nGermany. He has a PhD in agricultural economics. However, he \nalso has knowledge and perspectives that came from other parts of his identity. \nSince Matin is now working with you, it is important to understand who he is. \nTo help you, Matin filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Matin’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• 52-year-old man\n• Family: “I’m married to a wonderful wife and with two lovely daughters (17 and \n15 years old).”\n• Tall: “I am a very tall guy (usually the tallest person around) and have black hair \n(now getting gray).”\n• Born in Germany and lives in Bonn. “My mother is German, but my father is \noriginally from Pakistan, so I grew up in a mixed-culture family.”\n• “I ride my bike to the office every day, a nice 7-km tour along the river Rhine.”\n• Researcher: “I am analyzing how the situation of poor people in the Global \nSouth could be improved. Much of my research relates to small-scale farmers in \ncountries of Africa and Asia.”\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 50    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n• Likes traveling and has seen many different countries and places; loves getting \nto know new places and cultures\n• Likes eating and cooking good food, if possible together with family and friends\n• Loves nature and enjoys hiking\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Matin’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Matin? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Matin? \n• Can you see anything about Matin’s identity, in addition to his university \ndegrees, that would help him understand different perspectives or ideas about \nsustainable food systems? \nThroughout this task you will notice Matin sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. He may help you understand better ways to do your research, or share some \nof the research he has done.\nDiscover: What are the challenges to food systems?\nMost people eat food most days. But you may not know much about where your food \ncomes from or how it gets to you. Sometimes people do not get the food they need \nbecause of problems in the food system. In this activity you will find out more about \nthe food system and how it works.\n\t 1. Get out a piece of paper and something to write or draw with.\n\t 2. On the top of the paper draw a picture of your favorite or most recent meal, or \nwrite a description, if you prefer.\n\t a. Include all the parts of the meal you can remember, like if you had dessert. \nDo not worry if your drawing is not perfect; this paper is just to help you think.\n\t 3. Draw an arrow underneath and pointing toward your meal.\n\t 4. Now think about where the food you ate came from. For example, was it bought \nat a store, a market, or at a restaurant? Did you grow or catch it yourself? Draw or \nwrite what you know about where your meal came from. If the food came from \nmore than one place, draw or write all the places you can remember.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 51    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t 5. Draw an arrow underneath and pointing toward what you just drew or wrote.\n\t 6. Now think about where the food came before that. For example, did a farmer \nharvest it and bring it to a market, did a factory produce it and ship it to a store, \ndid a supplier buy it and deliver it to a restaurant? Draw or write what you know. \nIt is very possible you may not be sure, and that is okay. If you are uncertain, just \ndraw a question mark. \n\t 7. Keep using arrows and moving down the page until you either don’t know any \nmore information or you get to the place where the food was grown. An example \nof this sheet is shown in Figure 2-1.\nFigure 2-1: Example of a food system drawing.\n\t 8. Examine your paper. It represents what you know about your food system. How \nmight someone else’s paper be different? What if they ate different things or they \nlived in a different place?\n\t 9. At each step think about any problems that could arise and use words or drawings \nnext to each arrow to show what those problems could be. For example:\n\t a. Maybe the food you ate was bought at a store. If you did not have much money \nor the price of food became very expensive, would you be able to buy it?\n\t b. Maybe there is a problem transporting the food from one place to another.\n\t c. Maybe there are problems with growing or storing the food.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 52    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t10. Stop and think quietly to yourself: Have you experienced problems with the food \nsystem? Consider:\n\t a. Have you ever had trouble affording food? For example, sometimes food can \nbecome more expensive, which is called inflation.\n\t b. Has the food you want ever been unavailable? For example, during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic many stores sometimes had empty shelves.\n\t c. Have you ever noticed or been told about farmers struggling with weather or \npests when growing food?\n Emotional Safety Tip\nIt can be difficult to think about times you did not get the food you \nneeded. It is okay to feel sad or angry. Your experience with the food \nsystem is not your fault, but you can become part of working to make \nthe food system better.\n\t\nDiscuss with your team: What do you think the biggest challenges are to the food \nsystem? Read what Matin’s says to help you think consider new ideas.\nMatin says . . . \nThe goal of the food system is to nourish all people in a healthy \nway. Not only does that mean producing enough calories, it also \nmeans having enough of all the nutrients needed for healthy \nliving. Obviously, food production plays an important role, \nespecially with the land, water, and energy constraints on our \nplanet. But there are also questions of distribution. Where are \nthings produced? Who is producing them? Who has access? How do we limit food \nloss and waste? What are we eating and how does that affect the planet?\n\t\nWith your team, examine Figures 2-2 and 2-3. They show information about \nglobal food insecurity. Food insecurity is when a person lacks reliable access to \naffordable, nutritious food.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 53    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t\nFigure 2-2: Global food insecurity, 20201.\nFigure 2-3: Drivers of severe food insecurity and crisis, 20212.\n13. On a piece of paper or the board, draw three columns and label them “Notice,” \n“Think,” and “Wonder.”\n\t\n\tFill in the columns with your team.\n\t a. In the Notice column, write everything you notice about the graphs. What do \nthey show?\n\t b. In the Think column, write everything you think about what is causing the \nproblems you noticed on the graphs.\n\t c. In the Wonder column, write everything you wonder about the graphs, \nespecially about what would make the graphs have different information.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 54    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t\nConsider what you have written in the columns and read Matin’s ideas. Discuss \nwith your team:\n\t a. What are your hopes for how the information in these graphs might improve \nin the future?\n\t b. What are your concerns about how the information in these graphs might \nget worse? Be sure to consider how growing food might be affected by the \nchanging climate, which can cause severe weather events such as heat waves, \ndrought, floods, and hurricanes.\nMatin says . . . \nMany people are poor and under-nourished today. And \npopulations are growing. Estimates tell us we need to be able \nto nourish 10 billion people in the future. And at the same time \nclimate change is a major challenge to the food system. The \nchallenges are so big that we need all of the tools that can help. \nIt is not either/or. We really need to bring technology and many \nother things together to help create a sustainable food system.\nUnderstand: How can biotechnology help solve food system challenges?\nWe eat many types of food, but one of the most important types are plants. The plants \ngrown for food around the world have changed over time. Farmers and scientists have \nbeen working on making plants better for people for thousands of years. \n\t 1. Work with a partner to answer the following questions, if you can.\n\t a. How do you think people have modified plants over time? Remember what \nyou learned in Part 1.\n\t b. Think about the biotechnology tools you are familiar with. Which ones do you \nthink could be used to change a plant’s DNA?\n\t 2. Read Overview of Agricultural Biotechnology and discuss what you learned with \nyour partner.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 55    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\nOverview of Agricultural Biotechnology\nThere are several ways to use biotechnology techniques to modify or change \nplants and their DNA.\nFor many years farmers and researchers have used selective breeding to \ndevelop crops that are easier to grow and harvest, are tastier, or last longer after \nbeing picked. Often, they will breed two plants together to try to have specific \ntraits in their offspring that exist in one or both parent plants. This is known as \ncrossbreeding. \nThere are also ways to use genetic engineering techniques to modify plants. \nGenetic modification in plants often has similar goals to selective breeding—for \nexample, making the plant more resistant to pests, more nutritious, or better able \nto withstand harsh conditions, like a drought.\nFigure 2-4: A genetic engineer at work.\nOne genetic modification technique involves using a transgene, which is a gene \nfrom another species. Genetic engineers can choose a gene from a different \nspecies and insert it in the DNA of a plant. This process is called gene insertion. \nA transgene insertion often improves crops much faster than would be possible \nthrough crossbreeding. Living things that have been modified using transgenes \nare called GMOs or genetically modified organisms. GMOs have been developed \nand used for the past 30 years.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 56    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\nMore recently, scientists have started using gene editing techniques, such \nas CRISPR, to make targeted changes to DNA without having to use a gene \nfrom another living thing. For example, gene editing techniques make small \nmodifications to the DNA to “turn off” a gene and stop it from being expressed. \nOr gene editing can modify a specific gene within the DNA, creating new traits \nthat plant breeders can use. Gene editing is a more precise tool and can be used \nin many ways to make small adjustments to the DNA of a plant. \nFigure 2-5: Representation of small changes  \nto DNA such as those that might be made using CRISPR.\n\t 3. You and your partner will now become genetic engineers. Read the Genetic \nEngineering guide carefully. You will be working together to decide how to modify \nthe plants in each scenario.\n\t 4. After you read the guide, go through each Genetic Modification Card and \ndecide whether in each scenario you should use gene insertion, gene editing, or \ncrossbreeding. Then list which gene you would try to add or change.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 57    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\nGoals: \n1.  Consider each plant and location.\n2.  Decide the trait that needs to be modified.\n3.  Select a type of tool to modify the trait.\n4.  Choose what you would add or change.\nToolkit: \n•\t Gene insertion: Allows you to give your plants traits of other organisms \n•\t Gene editing: Allows you to change current traits in your plant\n•\t Crossbreeding: Allows you to give your plants traits of other members \nof its species by breeding those members together\nIssues modifications might address: \nDrought, nutrition, space, food waste, pests, and others\nGenetic Engineering Guide\nGenetic Modification Card\nCotton\nGenetic Modification Card\nRice\nGenetic Modification Card\nTomatoes\nScenario: \nSebastian’s cotton plants are constantly eaten by an invasive species.

But your local community might have some challenges as well. Discuss:\n\t a. Are there invasive species, extreme weather, or other situations that make it \nhard to grow food in your community?\n\t b. Are there challenges to growing food in your community due to the changing \nclimate?\n\t c. Are there other problems in your community, like poor nutrition or lack of \nspace to grow plants, that modifying plants might help solve?\n\t 6. As a team, decide: If you had to choose one problem in your community to solve \nthrough genetic modification of plants, what would the problem be?\n\t 7. Now think about how a plant would need to be modified to help solve that problem. \n\t a. You can choose a modification like one of those listed in the Genetic \nEngineering Cards.\n\t b. Or you can think of a new modification you believe might be important.

Right now, even with using \npesticides, around 30% to 40% of the potential harvest is never \nachieved because of losses to pests and diseases. So if we could \ndevelop more resistant crops we could not only reduce the use \nof pesticides, we could increase the yield and production levels \nof many crops.\nThinking about climate change, possible modifications are not only about heat or \ndrought or floods, although we could engineer plants to tolerate all of those things. \nClimate change also brings new types of pests in new places. With gene editing \nyou can develop new mechanisms relatively quickly to resist new pests. Also, we \ncan engineer crops that are very efficient in using soil nutrients, such as nitrogen. \nSo that can mean even with limited nitrogen in the soil or limited fertilizer, you \ncan have higher yields. You can also work on the root structure so more carbon \nis sequestered in the roots and in the soil and this carbon can stay in the soil \neven after we harvest. That’s very positive from a climate change mitigation \nperspective. There are lots of interesting objectives breeders can work on.\nAct: How should biotechnology be used to create a more sustainable \nfood system?\nThere are many challenges to our food systems. People around the world go hungry \ndaily because of political, financial, and environmental issues. It is exciting to think \nabout creating plants that could help feed the world affordable, nutritious food and \nare able to resist environmental challenges, like drought, salty soil, or invasive pests. \nBut there are concerns. In some countries GMOs are widespread. Other countries have \npartially or fully banned GMOs. In some countries gene editing in plants is becoming a \ncommon technique. In other countries, gene editing of plants is very controlled. Why \nis it so controversial to use new biotechnologies to change plants and how do you feel \nabout it?\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 60    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t 1.  Take out a piece of paper and divide it into two sections. Label one “Hopes” and \nthe other “Concerns.”\n2.  Under Hopes list the positive possibilities you can think of related to using genetic \nengineering of plants for a better future. How could GMOs or gene edited plants \nhelp solve food system problems? For example: \na. Could genetically engineered plants help create more food using less space \nand allow for less food waste? \nb. Could genetically engineered plants help people adapt to a changing climate? \nc. Could genetically engineered plants help create a wider variety of crops? \nd. Could genetically engineered plants help protect ecosystems by limiting the \nneed for new fields or other areas devoted to agriculture? (An ecosystem is a \ncommunity of living and nonliving things.)\ne. If you need help, think about the modified plants you learned about in the \nUnderstand activity to get you started.\n3.  Get out your Ethical Concerns List from Part 1. Examine it closely with your team. \nWhich of the ethical concerns do you think are relevant to the conversation about \ngenetically engineered plants? List those under Concerns.\n4.  As a team, discuss the following ethical issues related to GMOs or gene-edited \nplants. If your team thinks an issue is important, list it under Concerns.\na. Safety: What if eating genetically engineered plants causes disease or allergic \nreactions?\nb. Unbalanced ecosystems: There is a possibility that genetically engineered \nplants interact with the natural systems in unanticipated ways. For example, \nwhat if pest-resistant GMOs just encourage the development of pests that are \nable to overcome the pest-resistance? \nc. Persistence: GMOs put something into natural settings that did not naturally \noccur. Will the modification spread to other species or remain in nature even \nafter farmers have stopped using GMO crops? \nd. Access: GMOs are often created by companies. These companies often make \nfarmers buy GMO seeds every year; they cannot use seeds from last year’s \ncrop. Sometimes GMO plants only work if you buy the company’s pesticide as \nwell. This can get very expensive.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 61    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t e. Decision-making: What if one farmer does not want to have genetically \nengineered plants but the neighboring farmer wants to? Many genetically \nengineered plants can spread and end up on a farm where they were \nnever planted. Who should decide who can plant and where they can plant \ngenetically engineered plants?\n\t 5.  Read Matin’s thoughts about the health and safety of genetically engineered \nplants. Do his ideas change your opinion about any of the concerns you were \nworried about?\nMatin says . . . \nSome people have a general concern that biotechnology is risky \nfor human health, for the environment, or both. But from my \nperspective, we now have 30 years of scientific evidence that \nbiotechnology techniques like GMOs or gene editing are not \ninherently risky. Just like the technique of crossbreeding is not \ninherently risky. All these techniques could create products that \nmight be risky. For example, maybe a new crop variety has a trait that creates an \nenvironmental or health risk. We need to evaluate that. But we should evaluate all \nnew varieties, regardless of the techniques that were used to develop them.\nThere are other concerns about gene editing and GMOs, such as ethical concerns, \nthat should be considered separately. Such as who owns the technology and what \ndo they charge to use it? Is it only owned by large corporations? How could it lead \nto situations where some people may not have access? Are the new technologies \nonly being applied to large commercial crops, such as soybeans, maize and \ncotton? What about other crops that might be more useful in different places? \nIf we only modify a few crops, how does that affect the overall variety of crops \npeople grow? These are all valid concerns. \n\t 6.  Quietly by yourself, think about how to balance the hopes and concerns about \ngenetic engineering of plants. \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 62    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t a. Not using genetic engineering could increase the risk of not producing the \namount and type of food needed. Using genetic engineering presents other \nrisks. What do you think the balance should be?\nb. Do you think there is a way to allow for genetically engineered plants to help \nsolve food system problems?\nc. If so, are there rules that could help address the concerns?\n7.  Write down what you think the rules should be in your country about creating and \nusing genetically engineered plants. Be sure to consider:\na. When genetically engineered plants should be allowed: Never? Always? \nSomewhere in between?\nb. Should the rules for GMOS and gene-edited plants be the same?\nc. What kinds of safeguards should there be with GMOs or gene-edited plants? \nWhat kinds of testing would be needed to make sure the environment and \npeople are safe?\nd. When you buy something, should the label have to say whether it contains \nGMOs or gene-edited plants?\ne. Should companies be allowed to ban people from using genetically \nengineered plant seeds they have collected from their fields?\nf. Read Matin’s ideas to help you.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMatin says . . . \nAgricultural biotech is a transformative technology. And like all \ntransformative technologies, we need to think about having \nproper regulation, ensuring there is competition and there \nis access. Transformative technologies have the power to \naggravate certain existing power imbalances.\n\t 8.  Share your ideas with your teammates. Do other people have different ideas? Listen \ncarefully to one another while you explain your perspectives. Are there ideas you agree \non? Make a note of those ideas. Can you find a compromise if you disagree on certain \nideas? Try to build a team consensus, a balanced decision that works for everyone, on \nwhat you think the genetic engineering rules for plants should be in your country. \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 63    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 1\n\t\n Emotional Safety Tip\nThere are no wrong or right answers. Different people can have different \nperspectives. Considering different perspectives helps the group think \nbetter together. It may feel difficult to disagree with someone or have \nthem disagree with you. Remember, disagree with ideas, not with people. \nFor example, you could say, “I disagree with that idea because . . .”\n9.  Find out more about what the rules are for your country. You can use a \ngovernment website, a library, or other resources in the Biotechnology! StoryMap.\n 10.  Discuss with your team: \na. Do you agree with the rules in your country? \nb. If not, what would you want to change?\n 11.  With your team, draw a circle and label it “Personal.” In the circle, write or draw \nthings you can do in your own life to encourage the rules you want to see about \ngenetically engineered plants—for example, buying or not buying food made \nwith genetically engineered plants.\n 12.  Next draw a bigger circle around the first one. Label this circle “Community.” In \nthe circle, write or draw things you could do in your community to encourage the \nrules you want—for example, telling others about your opinion or educating them \nabout genetic engineering in plants.\n 13.  Next draw an even bigger circle around the other ones. Label this circle “Country.” \nIn the circle, write or draw things you could do in your country to encourage the \nrules you want. For example, is there a way to share your opinion with the people \nin the government who are making the rules?\n 14.  Finally, draw an even bigger circle around the other ones. Label this circle “World.” \nIn the circle, write or draw things you could do globally to encourage the plant \ngenetic engineering rules you want. For example, could you join an organization \nwith others around the world who have similar goals?\n 15.  Choose one thing you want to do and create a plan for how to do it.\na. How will you get started?\nb. What steps do you need to take?\nc. How will you do them?\n 16.  Put your ideas into action!\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 64    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nTask 2: How can biotechnology help food systems \ncontribute to a more sustainable future? \nPeople around the world eat a wide variety of foods. Each region of the world has \nits own special dishes, favorite beverages, and food-based traditions. But no matter \nwhat kind of food people eat, one thing remains the same: Producing food requires \nresources such as space, water, soil, and nutrients. A nutrient is something that helps a \nliving thing survive and grow. \nAs you have already read, there is high demand for food around the world. Agriculture \nhelps to meet that demand for food. But sometimes the way people produce food \ncan cause damage to the environment. Soil, water, and nutrients can be used in \nunsustainable ways. For example, some farms might use large amounts of fertilizer, \nwhich is a kind of nutrient to help plants grow. But sometimes during rainstorms, \nfertilizer can run off from fields and pollute rivers, streams, and drinking water. \nIn this task you will discover how Earth’s surface is used to produce food. Then you \nwill use models of farms, forests, and cities to understand how people can use \nbiotechnology to produce food in a more sustainable way. Finally, you will act to \nmodel and communicate some of those sustainable solutions to your community. \nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Mwamy Mlangwa. Mwamy (pronounced MWAH-mee) is \none of the many experts around the world thinking about how \nto create a sustainable food system. \nMwamy is the creator and owner of Mwamy Green Veggies, \nthe first hydroponic farm in Tanzania. Her rooftop hydroponic \ngreenhouse is located in the city of Dar es Salaam and produces \nlettuce and other vegetables. Mwamy has degrees in business administration and \nmarketing and worked in corporations before switching to farming. \nMwamy also has knowledge and perspectives that come from other parts of her \nidentity. Since Mwamy is now working with you, it is important to understand \nwho she is. \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 65    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nTo help you, Mwamy filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Mwamy’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• 48 years old\n• African\n• Female\n• From Tanzania\n• Tanzania and Israel are important places to her\n• “I had been working for almost 18 years, and I said, that’s enough, I need to \ndo something for myself. As an African, we all grew up in the villages with \nfarming, but it’s always about local farming. So I went to Israel to study, learn \nabout, and work in hydroponic farms. Then I came home and said, ‘That’s what \nI’m going to do!’” \n• Interested in politics\n• Likes playing with her dogs, walking, farming, and baking\n• Tall, black hair, does not wear glasses\n• Loud, funny and kind\n• Parent\n• Part of the Modern Agriculture Women Group\n• “I am a risk taker, I am not afraid of falls in business or life.” \nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Mwamy’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Mwamy? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Mwamy? \n• Can you see anything about Mwamy’s identity, in addition to her degrees and \ntraining, that would help her understand different perspectives or ideas about \ncreating a sustainable food system? \nThroughout this task you will notice Mwamy sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. She may help you understand how to think about biotechnology and food or \nshare some of the work she has done.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 66    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nDiscover: How much of Earth’s surface can we use to produce food?\nGrowing food and raising livestock uses Earth’s resources. How much of the planet can \npeople actually use to meet their need for food? In this activity you will find out more \nabout what parts of Earth’s surface are used to produce food. \n\t 1. By yourself, take out a blank piece of paper. \n\t 2. Think about this question: How much of Earth’s surface do you think is used for \nmaking food?  \n\t 3. Now, imagine your blank piece of paper is the entire surface of Earth. Tear off a \nportion of the paper or use a pen or pencil to mark the area you think is used for \nmaking food. \n\t 4. Keep this piece of paper. You will need it at the end of this activity.\n\t 5. Take out another blank piece of paper. \n\t 6. Now you will model how much of Earth’s surface can be used to make food. \n\t 7. Use a pen or pencil to divide your paper into 10 equal parts, as shown in Figure 2-7.\nFigure 2-7: A paper model can be used to represent Earth’s surface.\n\t 8. Mark out or tear off seven of those parts, as shown in Figure 2-8.

Those parts \nrepresent barren land, such as glaciers, bare rock, and sand dunes. Barren land is \nland that does not easily support the growth of living things.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 68    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nFigure 2-10: A paper model of Earth’s surface with only the habitable surface remaining.\n\t\nYou should have seven parts remaining. These parts represent the land on Earth \nthat is habitable, or land that best supports living things. \n\t\nMark out or tear off half the remaining space, as shown in Figure 2-11. Those parts \nrepresent natural spaces like forests, shrubs, and lakes. They also include land used \nfor other human needs, like housing, highways, and factories. Those spaces are not \ntypically used for producing food. \nFigure 2-11: A paper model of Earth’s surface showing the part that is used for producing food.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 69    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMwamy says . . . \nMy farm, Mwamy Green Veggies, is a hydroponic farm on a city \nrooftop. A hydroponic farm is a way of farming without using \nsoil. The plants grow in water, and we deliver nutrients to each \nplant by putting the nutrients directly in the water. \nHydroponic farming doesn’t require a big space, and not \neveryone can afford to have five acres. But a small space? People \nhave that. In a small space, even on a balcony, you can still use hydroponics to \nproduce vegetables like tomatoes, or herbs like basil or coriander. And you get a \ngood income even if you are using a small space, because the crop yield is high, \nthe food is high-quality, and the food is safe. For a town, hydroponics is a really \nideal kind of farming. \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 70    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\n\t17.\tRead The Effects of Agriculture to learn more about the effects of some kinds of \nagriculture, such as growing crops or raising livestock on land. You will need to \nconsider these effects as you learn about how biotechnology can be used in \nagriculture.   \nThe Effects of Agriculture\nAgriculture is how people have produced most of their food for thousands of \nyears. Recently, agriculture has generally become more efficient, meaning we can \nproduce more food more quickly in the space we have. Producing large amounts \nof food quickly and inexpensively is sometimes called industrial farming. But \nthat efficiency can sometimes come at a cost. \nWater\nPlants and livestock need water to grow. Industrial farms may use water from \nrivers, lakes, or under the ground to help water the crops. This is helpful because \nfarmers can make sure their plants always have water, even in a drought. But using \nwater this way can create some problems too. Taking water from rivers and lakes \nmay remove important habitat for the plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria that \nwere living in or depending on that water. \nFigure 2-12: This machine sprays water onto a field. Notice the dry landscape behind the field. \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 71    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nNutrients\nPlants need nutrients to grow. Some industrial farmers use chemical fertilizer to \nhelp deliver nutrients to plants. But when water passes through the field, such \nas during a rainstorm or a flood, some of that chemical fertilizer may be washed \naway. A high concentration of fertilizer can act as a poison, hurting the land and \nwater where it ends up, and the living things nearby. \nSpace\nPlants and livestock need somewhere to grow. Sometimes, industrial farmers clear \na forest, wetland, grassland, or peat bog to make more space for fields or grazing \nland. When a forest is turned into agricultural land, the plants, animals, fungi, \nand bacteria that were once living there can no longer use it as their habitat. The \nbiodiversity of that area decreases. Biodiversity is the measure of how many \ndifferent living things are in a certain area. \nFigure 2-13: The dark area in this photograph is where the forest has been burned to make \nmore room for a palm oil plantation (the green plants). \nCarbon\nDisturbing the soil and cutting down trees can also reduce the ability of the land \nto store carbon. Soil and trees can capture and store carbon from the atmosphere. \nThis can help to reduce the effects of climate change. Releasing this carbon can \ncontribute to climate change. \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 72    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nSustainable agriculture\nNot all agriculture hurts the land. Farmers and researchers are searching actively \nfor new ideas about how to grow more food without hurting the environment. \nSometimes, the best ideas are old ideas. Many farmers and researchers are \nstarting to pay attention to traditional agricultural practices that have been more \nsustainable than industrial farming.  \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMwamy says . . . \nHydroponics is sustainable. The amount of water we use is \nminimal because the water rotates, or cycles over and over, \nthrough the pipes. This saves a lot of water versus traditional \nfarming. We don’t have to cut down trees or burn bushes to \nclear the land. We use fewer nutrients than traditional farming. \nIn traditional farming, once you put the nutrients in the soil, the \nsoil has lots of organisms other than plants that then use those nutrients. But in \nhydroponics, only the plant is using the nutrients.  \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 73    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nUnderstand: How can new techniques enable food to be grown in new places?\nIn the Discover activity, you modeled how much of Earth’s surface is currently used \nfor producing food. You also learned how certain kinds of agriculture can harm the \nenvironment. \nYou also know from your work in Task 1 that our planet is facing a food crisis. We need \nto find ways to produce more food without continuing to harm our planet. In this \nactivity, you will use a model to think about how to use biotechnology to produce \nfood more sustainably. Then you will apply this model to your own community. \n\t 1. Work with a partner. \n\t\n\tRead Where Can We Grow Tomatoes? for instructions on how to set up your model.\nWhere Can We Grow Tomatoes?\n\t a. Work with a partner to collect the following materials to set up your model:\n• 2 sheets of paper\n• 8 small objects (such as paper clips, scraps of paper, or coins)\n• Pen or pencil\n\t b. Use a pen or pencil to divide each sheet of paper into eight equal parts. \n\t c. Label one paper “Farm/Forest” and the other paper “City.”\n\t d. On the Farm/Forest paper, label four of the parts “Forest.” You can also draw a \nforest, use symbols, or mark the parts in another way, as long as you can tell \nthat it is forest.

Place the Farm/Forest paper in front of you and your partner. \n\t 4. Work with your partner to plant all eight tomato plants, or as many of those eight \ntomato plants as you would like to. Keep these rules in mind:\n\t a. You can plant only one tomato plant in each space. \n\t b. If you choose to plant tomatoes in a Forest space, it means you will get rid of \nthat section of forest. \n\t c. You can also choose not to plant any tomatoes in a space. \n\t 5.

Gather your eight small objects again and place the City paper in front of you and \nyour partner. \n\t 7. Your goal is to plant as many tomato plants as you can. Since this is a city, many of \nthe spaces are already being used to meet the needs of people. If you choose to \nplant tomatoes in a particular space, you will clear whatever is in that space. You \ncan also choose not to plant tomatoes in a space. \n\t 8. Work with your partner to do step 4 again on your City paper. \n\t 9. When you have finished planting, turn to another pair and answer the following \nquestions.\n\t a. How many tomato plants did you plant?\n\t b. Did you plant more or less than you did with the Farm/Forest paper? Why?\n\t c. How did you decide where to plant tomatoes?\n\t\nNow choose either the Farm/Forest or the City paper. You and your partner are \ngoing to make a decision again about planting tomatoes. But this time, you \nwill consider a new perspective when making your decision. Select just one \nperspective about the paper you chose, either the Farm/Forest or the City. \n\t a. If you chose the Farm/Forest paper, select one of the perspectives listed here: \n• Social: A food bank in your community needs more fresh food. They have \nasked you to clear forest land and plant as many tomatoes as possible to \nhelp people in need. \n• Economic: You work on the tomato farm in your community. If you don’t \nplant all eight spaces with tomatoes, you won’t earn enough wages to keep \npaying for your home. \n• Environmental: The forest near your tomato farm is the only habitat for a \nrare orchid plant. That orchid provides food for several kinds of insects in the \nforest. But more people have moved into your community, and there has \nbeen a huge demand for food, so you have been asked to clear some of the \nforest spaces. \n• Ethical: Your local government has just purchased large amounts of \npesticides. They will give them to farmers for free. You understand that \nthe pesticides can have a negative effect on humans and the nearby \nenvironment, and you are worried about that. But if you use the pesticides, \nyou can grow twice as many tomatoes per space. \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 76    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\n\t b. If you chose the City paper, select one of the perspectives listed here:\n• Social: The athletic field in your city is where young people and adults play \nsports. Older adults meet there every week for lawn games and socializing. \nThe field has plenty of soil, sunlight, and access to water. Some people in \nthe community have asked to tear up the field and plant tomatoes there \ninstead.\n• Economic: You have asked to use a large lawn next your apartment building \nto plant more tomatoes. But the owner of the apartment building wants \nto build another set of apartments on that space. The new apartments will \nbring in a lot of money for the building owner.\n• Environmental: The community center has a garden with native plants. \nThose plants provide food and habitat for several species of birds, insects, \nfrogs, and bats. That space could also be used to grow tomatoes, which \ncould be distributed to local residents.\n• Ethical: People want to travel through the city on the highway, but that \nmeans less space is available to the people who live there to relax, be in \nnature, or have fresh food grown nearby.\n\t\n Now gather up your eight small objects and decide where to plant your tomatoes, \nconsidering only the one perspective you chose. \n\t\nDid the way you planted tomatoes change? Why or why not?\n\t\nNext, read Vertical Farming.\nVertical Farming\nIf you have ever noticed a corn or soybean field, you might have observed that \ngrowing food in soil can take up a lot of space. How can people produce the \nsame amount of food without using as much space? Vertical farming is a type of \nbiotechnology that might help solve that problem. Vertical farming grows plants \nin vertically stacked racks, often indoors. The racks take up less horizontal space \nthan a field but can still produce a huge amount of food. Figure 2-16 shows an \nexample.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 77    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nFigure 2-16: The photo on the left shows the way crops are arranged on an industrial farm. \nThe photo on the right shows how crops are arranged in a vertical farm.\nThe plants may grow in water, air, or in a material that provides a small amount of \nsupport, like gravel. Light is provided using either electric lights or natural sunlight \n(such as in a greenhouse). \nWhat are the possible benefits of vertical farming?\n• Farmers can reuse the water that flows through the racks, which allows them to \nuse less water overall. \n• Crops can be grown in places that don’t have usable soil, such as a paved area or \na row of buildings. \n• The racks help farmers deliver water and nutrients directly to each plant. \n• Controlling the temperature, light, and humidity inside the vertical farm allows \ncrops to be grown all year long.\n• Crops can be grown directly in the communities that use them.\nWhat are the possible challenges to vertical farming?\n• It can be expensive to set up and maintain.\n• It requires construction of the racks, a water connection, and lighting.\n• Farmers may need to pay for the use of the space, electricity, water, air \nconditioning or heat, and nutrients.\n• Because the racks share a water source, when one plant gets a disease it can \nspread very quickly from plant to plant.\n• Only certain crops can grow well in vertical racks. For example, corn is too tall to \ngrow in racks.\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 78    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\n\t\nWork with your partner to review your choices from steps 4 through 8. Imagine \nthat you could use vertical farming to “plant” tomatoes by stacking your objects on \ntop of one another. Then answer the following questions:\n\t a. What would you do differently on the Farm/Forest paper if you were able to \nuse vertical farming? \n\t b. What would you do differently on the City paper if you were able to use \nvertical farming? \n\t\nRead what Mwamy says about the benefits and challenges of hydroponic farming \nin her community. Do her ideas make you change your mind about when you \nwould use vertical farming?\nMwamy says . . . \nSometimes I do get some pests on my lettuce, and I don’t have \nany choice but to remove the lettuce and burn it. You have to be \nvery careful with your system and the people you are working \nwith. A small mistake can kill everything. One small mistake and \neverything goes.\nYou cannot easily grow potatoes or any other root vegetable \nlike carrots or beetroot. You can grow tomatoes, strawberries, you can grow even \ncucumbers because they are hanging. \nThe investment is a challenge. It’s quite big. If you want to do commercial like me, \nyou have to go huge—the greenhouses, the pipes, the water systems, pumps. This \nis one of the big disadvantages. But the market for your vegetables is there. \nI mostly sell to the supermarkets in Dar es Salaam, international hotels, \nrestaurants, and the safari camps. In Tanzania we have a lot of safari camps, and \nmost of them are catering to Europeans, and those people want fresh salad. My \nsalads have longer shelf life. They can stay fresh for seven days without dying \nbecause I’m selling them with the roots attached. Most of the safaris are up to \nseven days long. So if they buy from me, a safari chef has salad that can stay fresh \nfor seven days. They love it! \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 79    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\nFigure 2-17: Fresh lettuce grows in a hydroponic greenhouse.\n\t\nVertical farming could be a solution you use in your own community. Work with a \npartner or a small group to find spaces in your community that could be used for a \nvertical farm. \n\t17. Read Vertical Farming Investigation for instructions. \nVertical Farming Investigation \n\t a. Gather as a team.\n\t b. Read about the kinds of materials you might need to build a vertical farm. \nMaterials needed for a vertical farm\n• Indoor space that you are allowed to use\n• A space that has climate control for temperature and humidity\n• Electricity \n• A source of water\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 80    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\n• Money for materials (or donated materials)\n• Tools to build the vertical growing rack\n• Seeds or seedlings of plants that grow well in vertical farm spaces\n\t c. Work with your team to think together about a space in your community that \ncould be used for a vertical farm. Think about the materials needed for a vertical \nfarm to help you find a space that would work well. For example, does the space \nyou are considering have electricity and a source of water? To find a space you can:\n• Move around your community and search for buildings, warehouses, sheds, \ngreenhouses, shipping containers, parking garages, or other spaces that are \nnot being used.\n• Use an online mapping program (such as Google Maps) to find the \nbuildings and other spaces in your community.\n• Talk to the people in your household, friends, or elders and ask about spaces \nthat might be good for vertical farming.\n\t d. Once you have found a space that might work for vertical farming, work as \na team to imagine what your vertical farm might be like. Create a drawing, \nphysical model, written description, or use another format like a video or \naudio recording to record the design of your vertical farm.\nFigure 2-18: What would you need to change about this abandoned  \ntrain station to use it for vertical farming? \nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 81    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\n\t\nThink about this question by yourself: What problems could vertical farming help \nsolve in your community? \nAct: How can I help my community produce food more sustainably?\nSome parts of your community might have trouble getting affordable, reliable access \nto food. Biotechnology, like vertical farming, could help directly connect people in \nyour community with food. But some people may be unfamiliar with or nervous about \nbiotechnology. In this activity, you will ask questions in your community to learn about \npeoples’ attitudes toward biotechnology and share your ideas for a vertical farm. \n\t 1. Start a conversation about food with a trusted adult member of your community. \nUse the following questions to guide your conversation.\n\t a. Are there parts of our community that you wish had more access to food—for \nexample, places that don’t have grocery stores nearby? \n\t b. If we could produce food right here in our community, what kind of food \nwould you want? \n\t c. What do you think might be the good parts of being able to produce food in \nour community? What might be some bad parts? \n\t d. If I said we could use biotechnology to produce more food in our community, \nhow does the word “biotechnology” make you feel? \n\t 2. Get out your plan for vertical farming. First, ask:\n\t a. Have you ever heard of vertical farming?\n\t b. If they haven’t, explain what you have learned about vertical farming.\n\t 3. Now share your plan for a vertical farm with this adult. Explain the benefits, \nchallenges, and what food the farm could produce. \n\t 4. Ask for suggestions about your plan from the adult. For example:\n\t a. Do you agree with the place I’ve picked for the farm? \n\t b. What kinds of crops do you think could grow in this place?\n\t c. What haven’t I thought of?\n\t d. What are your hopes for agriculture in your community? \n\t e. What are your concerns about agriculture in your community?\nBiotechnology!     Part 2 – Page 82    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 2 Task 2\n\t 5. Read that Mwamy says about how her community responded to her hydroponic \nfarm. How do you predict your community will respond to using biotechnology to \nincrease food production?\nMwamy says . . . \nMy community, my government responded very well to my \nhydroponic farm. Especially the youth! Most of the youth in \nTanzania, they like farming, but they don’t like the old way of \nfarming. \nMany people in Tanzania prefer cooked vegetables, but I always \nencourage people to try eating salad! I don’t want us to stay \nwhere we were 20 years ago. Now the good thing is that people care about their \nhealth, so they go for the vegetables. I’m telling you, at first it was really hard. But \nnow my lettuce doesn’t stay more than two days in the supermarket—it is off the \nshelf! \nCongratulations!\nYou have finished Part 2.\nFind Out More!\nFor additional resources and activities, please visit the Biotechnology!

A material is any substance that makes up an object. \nThe places we live, our furniture, our clothes, our food, the products we use, our means \nof transportation all require materials. Where do these materials come from and is the \nway we are using them sustainable? What alternatives exist? In this task you will first \ndiscover more about your own use of materials and whether it is sustainable. Then \nyou will investigate to understand more about sustainable materials created using \nbiotechnology. Finally, you will act on this information and decide how this will affect \nyour use of materials in the future.\nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Young Kim. Young (pronounced YUHNG) is one of the \nmany researchers around the world trying to use biotechnology \nto make materials more sustainable. \nYoung is an associate professor of sustainable biomaterials \nat Virginia Tech University in the United States. He has a PhD \nin packaging science. However, he also has knowledge and \nperspectives that came from other parts of his identity. Since Young is now \nworking with you, it is important to understand who he is. \nTo help you, Young filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Young’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• 52 years old\n• Received PhD from Clemson University, class of 2005\n• Asian (South Korean)\n• Male\n• Lives in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA\n• Strong ties to South Korea and the USA \n• Interested in how to use bioplastics more efficiently and economically\n• Likes video games and golf\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 93    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\n• Wears glasses and short hair, “like soldier style”\n• Believes in always having a positive mindset\n• Money-maker of the household\n• Part of Packaging Systems and Design Group housed in the Department of \nSustainable Biomaterials at Virginia Tech\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Young’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Young? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Young? \n• Can you see anything about Young’s identity, in addition to his university \ndegrees, that would help him understand different perspectives or ideas about \nsustainable materials? \nThroughout this task you will notice Young sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. He may help you understand better ways to do your research, or share some \nof the research he has done.\nDiscover: What are the sustainability issues with the materials we use?\nEvery day we are all using different materials. Some materials are natural, like wood, \nstone, and sand. Some materials, such as plastic, steel, and concrete, are created by \npeople. Scientists believe the mass of human-made materials is now greater than \nthe mass of all living things on Earth. In this task you will be thinking about the \nconsequences of using and creating different types of materials. How sustainable are \nthe materials around you?\n\t 1. With your team, sit in a circle. \n2. Have each person on your team try to name a material used in each of the \nfollowing categories. For example, for buildings someone might say “wood.” You \ncan say a natural material such as “stone” or a human-made material such as \n“bricks.” You may not know all the materials that are part of a category. That’s okay, \njust do your best. When someone can’t think of an answer, move on to the next \ncategory.\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 94    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\n\t a. Buildings and construction\nb. Household goods (furniture, appliances, utensils, etc.)\nc. Clothing\nd. Packaging (of food; beauty, medical, personal and household products; \ntransported items, etc.)\ne. Infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.)\n3. Pick one item you or your teammates listed and think quietly to yourself:\na. Where does that material come from? For example, is it dug out of the Earth?\nb. What happens to it when it is no longer being used? For example, does it get \nrecycled? Does it go into a landfill? Does it go into the air? Does it enter the \nwaterways? Does it get burned?\nc. What do you think makes a material sustainable? Read Young’s ideas.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nYoung says . . . \nThere are many different parts to a material being sustainable. \nIs the source of the material sustainable? Does the material \ncreate high carbon emissions, polluting the atmosphere? \nThere are many ways to increase the sustainability of \nmaterials—for example, improving the processing technology \nto consume less energy, reusing the material, and recycling. \nThinking about where the material comes from and what happens to it when it is \nthrown away is an important part of sustainability.\n\t 4. As a team, discuss, what does it mean for a material to be sustainable? For example:\na. Are sustainable materials made from resources that are renewable, meaning \neasily replenished? Often this means they’re based on something that could \ngrow back quickly, like a fast-growing plant, fungus, or bacteria. This is \nsometimes called biobased.\nb. Are sustainable materials biodegradable, meaning able to break down \nrelatively quickly in a natural environment? For example, would they \ndecompose quickly in a compost heap or if they reached a waterway?\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 95    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\n\t c. Are sustainable materials affordable, meaning inexpensive?\nd. Are sustainable materials durable, meaning able to be reused many times or \nhave their materials easily recycled?\ne. Are sustainable materials low-resource, meaning made without needing a \ngreat deal of energy or water or other natural resources?\nf. Are sustainable materials clean, meaning they add only minimal greenhouse \ngases or other types of pollution to the natural environment? \n5. With your team, use a piece of paper or the board to create a Sustainability Profile \nchart like the one in Figure 3-1.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiodegradable\nClean\nRenewable\nLow Resource\nDurable\n©Smithsonian Institution\nFigure 3-1: Sample Sustainability Profile chart.\n\t 6. Read The Life Cycle of a Plastic Water Bottle and search for information about \nwhether the material used to create the plastic water bottle is renewable, \nbiodegradable, affordable, durable, low-resource, and clean.\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 96    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\nThe Life Cycle of a Plastic Water Bottle\nMillions of years ago, living things in the ocean like algae and zooplankton died, \nsank to the sea floor, and were buried in sediment. Over time, the bodies of these \nliving things were compressed deep into the Earth. That compression changed \nthem into a fossil fuel known as crude oil. \nThen in recent times workers drilled deep into the Earth to reach the crude oil. They \npumped the oil out of the Earth and sent it through a pipeline to be refined. At the \nrefinery other workers heated and distilled the crude oil to separate it into different \nparts. One part was heated at high temperatures to break it into short molecules. \nSome of these molecules were combined into long strings called polymers with \na process that uses heat, water, and other chemicals. The resulting plastic is called \nPET. The PET was formed into small pellets and shipped to a plastic bottle factory. \nOnce the PET pellets reached the factory they were melted down and had air \nblown inside them while pushing the molten PET against a mold to form a bottle. \nThe bottles were filled with water, capped, packed, and shipped to a store. \nAt the store, the water bottle was inexpensive. A person bought it, drank the \nwater, and got rid of the bottle.\nFigure 3-2: Plastic bottles after use.\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 97    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\nThe rest of the story could go in many different directions. Sometimes, the bottle \nis thrown away and ends up in a landfill where it will not degrade for hundreds \nof years. Or the bottle could be burned with other trash for fuel, releasing carbon \ninto the atmosphere. Or the bottle could be recycled into other products, such as \nanother bottle or a T-shirt. But plastic is usually only recycled a few times before \nthe quality decreases, and it is no longer usable. Or someone could litter or bottles \ncould be washed out of a landfill. Then a bottle could enter the waterway and \nmake its way to the ocean, where it will float, slowly breaking into smaller pieces \nfor hundreds of years. These plastics and microplastics can cause problems for sea \nlife and human health. In fact, by weight, plastic bottles are the most littered items \non beaches around the world. \n\t 7. Fill out the Sustainability Profile for a plastic bottle, based on The Life Cycle of \na Plastic Water Bottle. For each characteristic, such as biodegradable, rank the \nplastic bottle from very bad (1) to very good (5) and draw a dot at that number \nalong the line. Don’t worry if you don’t have a good answer to one or more of the \ncharacteristics. Just do your best. Connect the dots between the lines. You now \nhave the plastic bottle’s sustainability profile. Figure 3-3 shows an example.\nBiodegradable\nClean\nRenewable\nLow Resource\nDurable\n©Smithsonian Institution\nFigure 3-3: Example of a typical plastic water bottle’s sustainability profile.\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 98    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\n\t 8. Think quietly to yourself: Can you think of a material that might have a better \nsustainability profile than a plastic bottle?\n\t 9. Read Materials and Sustainability Search Instructions and carry out the instructions \non your own.\nMaterials and Sustainability Search Instructions\nLocation \nMove around your classroom, your school, home, or the space where you are \nlearning.\nMaterials\nSearch for items that are in the categories you listed in step 2. For example, maybe \nyou find a wooden table in your classroom or the sidewalk outside your home is \nmade of concrete. Pick one item to investigate.\nDecide on sustainability\nCreate a new Sustainability Profile chart like the one shown in Figure 3-1. Label the \nchart with the name of your item. Examine your item. For each characteristic on \nthe sustainability profile, decide on a number between 1 (very bad) and 5 (very \ngood) for your item and plot the number on the chart. If you are not sure, you can \nuse the Internet, the library, or another source to help you decide. If you cannot \nfind out the information, just take your best guess. When you have finished, \nconnect the numbers.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 99    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\nUnderstand: How could biotechnology help create more sustainable \nmaterials?\nCreating more sustainable materials is important. Biotechnology can help with this \nprocess. Sometimes biotechnology can help by using living things to create items we \nneed. Sometimes biotechnology can help by recycling waste products into usable \nmaterials. Sometimes biotechnology can help create and use proteins called enzymes, \nwhich speed up and encourage specific chemical reactions. In this task you will learn \nmore about how biotechnology can help make plastics more sustainable. Then you \nwill think about how biotechnology can change the sustainability profile of other \nmaterials.\n\t 1. Examine your Sustainability Profile for the plastic water bottle from the Discover \nactivity. Read each of the innovations Young shares and discuss with your team \nhow the new technique might change the sustainability profile of the plastic \nbottle.\nYoung says . . . \nYou may be familiar with poly-lactic acid (PLA). It is one of the \nmost common bioplastics. To create PLA, you have cornstarch \nor another food source for bacteria, bacteria eat it, and produce \nlactic acid. Then we polymerize the lactic acid and get PLA \nplastic. PLA is biobased and compostable in some situations.\n\t a. As Young explained, scientists have created polymers using materials such \nas cornstarch and the waste from sugarcane. These are sometimes called \nbioplastics. How would using cornstarch or sugarcane waste to create the \nmaterials used to make the plastic change the sustainability profile of a plastic \nbottle?\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 100    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\n\t\nYoung says . . . \nWe have another type of plastic called PHA that is \nbiodegradable in the ocean. This is important because although \nPLA is sometimes compostable, it does not biodegrade in the \nocean and we know a lot of plastic ends up in the ocean. \nb. How would the ability to biodegrade in the ocean change the sustainability \nprofile of a plastic bottle?\nYoung says . . . \nThere is also the question of what the bacteria are eating as \nthey produce the chemicals to make bioplastic. For example, \nsome scientists are engineering bacteria so they will eat waste \nplastic and then produce the chemicals needed to make ocean-\nbiodegradable plastic.\n\t c. If producing an ocean-biodegradable plastic could decrease the amount of \nplastic waste, as Young describes, how would that change the sustainability \nprofile of a plastic bottle?\n\t 2.

Put the cornstarch in a microwave-safe or heat-safe container.\nb. Add four drops of cooking oil using a pipette or eyedropper, or letting the \ndrops fall off the tip of your finger.\nc. Add the water.\nd. Add the food coloring (optional).\ne. Use the spoon to stir until the mixture is smooth.\nf. Heat in the microwave on medium heat for 30 to 90 seconds. Check it after \nevery 30 seconds. Your bioplastic should be clearer and dry to the touch. The \nthicker the bioplastic, the longer it will take in the microwave.\ng. If you are using a stovetop, stir the bioplastic over low heat until it turns \nclearer and becomes thick. \nh. Your container now has a flexible bioplastic! Wait until it cools a little bit and \nthen remove it from the container. If you want it in a particular shape, mold it \ninto that shape and leave it to cool completely.\ni.

Read Sustainable Material Innovations. For each innovation, match it with an \nexisting material from Figures 3-5 through 3-8. How do you think the innovation \nchanges the sustainability profile of the existing material?\nSustainable Material Innovations\nSelf-healing concrete has bacteria embedded into the concrete. These bacteria \ncan create concrete-like structures. So if a crack develops in the concrete, the \nbacteria will react to the air and water in the crack and fill it. This means the \nconcrete can last much longer without having to be replaced.\nMango leather is made from mango waste. It does not need the toxic chemicals \nused when making leather from cow hide. Mango leather avoids the greenhouse \ngases and deforestation caused by the cattle farming that is necessary to produce \nthe cow hides.\nFigure3-9: Leather made from mango waste.\nMushroom bricks are grown from fungi. They can grow into many different \nshapes and do not need high heat and energy to fire them, unlike clay bricks. \nWhen they are no longer being used, they can easily biodegrade.\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 106    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\nFigure 3-10: Stacked mushroom bricks.\nSugarcane plates can be made out of sugarcane waste.

Which material out of the ones you have explored seems most exciting to \nyou?\nAct: How should we use biomaterials?\nMany people would like to use sustainable materials, but there are reasons they \nare not able to do so. In this activity you will decide what aspects of sustainability \nyou think are most important for materials. You will consider whether there \nare ethical concerns about using some of the new materials created using \nbiotechnology. Then you will craft a message to share about the material you want \nothers to use.\n\t 1. Think about the new, more sustainable materials you learned about in the \nUnderstand activity. Pick the material that excited you the most. Sometimes even \nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 107    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\nthough a material can seem sustainable from one perspective, it can create a \nproblem from another perspective. Are there concerns about this material you can \nthink of from one of the four perspectives? Discuss with your team concerns from \ndifferent perspectives for each of the materials.\n\t a. From a social perspective, is using the less sustainable material an important \npart of your culture or part of keeping people healthy?\nb. From an economic perspective, is the new material more expensive to \nproduce? Could it be produced using existing production facilities, like \nfactories?\nc. From an environmental perspective, is there an impact on wildlife or the \natmosphere created by using the new material? For example, maybe farming \nmushrooms, mangoes, or sugarcane to use in sustainable materials will take \nland away from wild areas or will use a lot of pesticides.\nd. From an ethical perspective, will using this material make things more unfair, \nsuch as by increasing inequality between people?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 2. Examine the Sustainability Profile chart shown in Figure 3-1. Think quietly to \nyourself: Do you think all characteristics of a sustainability profile are equally \nvaluable or are some more important? If you think some are more important, \nwhich ones?\n3. Discuss your ideas with your teams and try to come to consensus on the material \nyou would be most excited to share information about with the rest of your \ncommunity. Consensus is not competing to win or lose. Coming to consensus \nmeans working together to find a balanced decision that works for everyone.\na. Are there certain perspectives you think are really important to consider?\nb. Are there some sustainability profile characteristics that everyone thinks are \nimportant?\nc. If people disagree, think back to your identity map and what you learned \nabout perspectives. How is your opinion related to your identity and past \nexperiences?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 4. With your team, think about what made you start using new or different materials \nin the past. Could you be part of changing how other people are using materials?\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 108    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 1\n\t 5. Develop a way to communicate about the material your team agreed on with \nothers in your community. For example:\na. Could you start using this material yourself and become an example to others?\nb. Can you create this material yourself and show others?\nc. Could you gather information and create an infographic to help people \nunderstand why this material is a better choice?\nd. Is there another way you would like to communicate?\n6. Decide what you will do. Make sure your plan can include everyone on your team.\n7. Use your communication technique to share information about the material you \nchose with your community. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 109    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\nTask 2: Can we create the materials we need using cells \nand biotechnology? \nImagine a world in which you could create the materials you need using \nbiotechnology. A world where engineered yeast and bacteria become the new \nfactories, where people needing a heart transplant receive a heart printed out of their \nown cells. In this task you will discover more about your connection to ways scientists \nare already using living things to create new products. Then you will investigate to \nunderstand how advances in using human cells for bioprinting are creating new \nopportunities. Finally, you will consider the possibilities and act to create the future \nyou want.\nDiscover: Could cells become the new factories?\nYou learned in Part 1 how biotechnology has used microorganisms like yeast and \nbacteria to create things like bread and yogurt. Those microorganisms use their \nnatural processes to produce carbon dioxide that makes bread rise or the lactic \nacid that makes yogurt sour. However, what if you were able to change the natural \nprocesses of microorganisms to produce different materials? Scientists are creating \nwhole new processes to create materials using biotechnology tools, like CRISPR. \nScientists now also have the ability to create entirely new sequences of DNA, known \nas synthetic DNA.\n\t 1. Remember, a material is any substance that makes up an object. If you think \nabout it, your body is composed of materials. With a partner, think about some of \nthe materials that are part of your body—for example, your hair, nails, bones, or \nstomach acid. Discuss with each other:\na. Where do these materials come from?\nb. How are cells involved in making materials in your body?\nc. Are cells sometimes part of the materials themselves?\nd. Can you think of any materials produced by cells in other living things?\n2. Read The Many Functions of the Cell.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 110    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nThe Many Functions of the Cell\nCells are the original production facilities. Each cell is busy, from tiny single-celled \norganisms like bacteria and algae to each one of the massive number of cells in a \nmulticellular organism like a whale or a redwood tree. Cells use the instructions \nfound in DNA to carry out many activities, such as:\n• Producing materials  \n• Processing waste \n• Using energy from the sun to create sugar from water and carbon dioxide in a \nprocess called photosynthesis, which removes carbon from the air and releases \noxygen\n• Growing and dividing \nCells produce many things and perform functions that are useful to themselves \nand the organisms of which they are a part. \nPeople have used existing products and processes from cells for thousands of \nyears, like when fermenting foods and creating beer, as you learned in Part 1. We \nuse these existing products and functions to fill some of our needs. But we have \nalways been limited by what the DNA in cells naturally produces or does. We fill \nother needs using chemical processes. \nHowever, we now have an easy-to-use set of tools to edit DNA. Using CRISPR or \nother biotechnology tools, we can change the DNA in cells to have a different or \nadditional set of instructions that will tell the cells to do different things. \n3.  With your partner, think together of what types of materials you wish cells could \nbe modified to make. For example:\na. Materials that might replace ones that are not sustainable\nb. Materials that are currently difficult or expensive to find or produce\nc. Natural materials that can not or should not be harvested from nature\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 111    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n4. Use drawings or words to capture your ideas and share with the rest of your team.\n5. Read Biotransformation and Design.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotransformation and Design\nWhen a cell makes a material, there are often several steps involved. Material A is \ntransformed into Material B, which is transformed into Material C. This process is \ncalled biotransformation. \nBiotransformation often uses enzymes to transform one material into another. For \nexample, in plants the biotransformation process of photosynthesis uses certain \nenzymes to transform carbon dioxide and water into sugar. \nWhen scientists want to use a living thing to make a material, they need to design \nthe biotransformative pathway. They figure out the steps to create the material \nthey want and what enzymes are needed. Each enzyme is coded for by a specific \ngene within the DNA. Scientists can find or even create a gene to code for each \nenzyme they need, and insert that gene into the cell they are using. \n\t\n\t\n6. Now you will have an opportunity to become a bioengineer and design your own \nbiotransformative pathway. Here are some details:\na. Your goal is to make artemisinic acid. Artemisinic acid can be used to make the \nbest treatment we have for malaria. It occurs naturally in a plant, but in very \nsmall amounts, so it is expensive. As a bioengineer, you would like to make \nartemisinic acid easier to make so it becomes cheaper. \nb. You can do this by inserting genes for different enzymes into your cell. If the \ncell has all the right genes for specific enzymes, it can transform a molecule \ncalled FPP into artemisinic acid. \nc. Right now you have FPP, Material A. \nd. You want to get artemisinic acid, Material E. \ne. There are four intermediate steps. \nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 112    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\nf.

Right now, scientists around the world are working on developing different \nbiotransformative pathways to create different products. Many pharmaceuticals, \nflavorings, fragrances, new bioplastics, and parts of beauty products are already \nbeing produced this way. What do you think will be next?\nUnderstand: Could we print organs using cells?\nCells can produce amazing things all by themselves. However, in a multicellular \norganism, like a human, cells do not work alone. They group together with other cells \nof the same type to form tissues, such as muscle or nerve tissues. Different tissues \ncombine to form organs, such as the heart, lungs, skin, and liver. Organs are more \ncomplex and generally are very important to the body.\n\t 1. Think quietly to yourself about the organs you know you have. The things you may \nthink of as “parts of the body” like your brain, kidney, and lungs are all organs.\na. Why do you think each organ is important?\nb. What would your life be like if one of your organs was damaged or \ndestroyed?\nc. If your organ fails or is no longer working, right now the best thing to do is \nreplace it. Starting in the 1950s, doctors have been doing transplants—taking \nan organ or part of an organ out of one person and putting it into another \nperson. How many organs do you think were transplanted worldwide in 2020? \nShare your guess with your team.\n2. Discuss with your team: In 2020 there were 129,681 transplants performed around \nthe world. However, many people needed a transplant who could not get one. \nWhat can you think of that might prevent someone from getting a transplant? \n3. Examine the chart of organ transplants in the United States in 2021, shown in \nFigure 3-14. Discuss with your team:\na. What problem do you notice?\nb. Can you think of anything that would help fix the problem?\nc. What questions do you have?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 114    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n Emotional Safety Tip\n You may know someone waiting for an organ transplant and it can be \nupsetting to think about how long they may need to wait.

Which organ is transplanted most often? If you want to \nexplore more about types of transplants or wait times in your country, you can use \nthe Biotechnology! StoryMap.\n5. Think to yourself: Imagine if people who needed organs did not need to get them \nfrom someone else. What if the organs could be grown from their own cells? How \ndo you think that could change the situation shown in Figure 3-14?\n6. Now consider quietly: Another problem with transplants is that your body’s \nimmune system reacts to cells from other people and sometimes can attack \ntransplanted organs. How would this situation change if organs could be grown \nfrom your own cells?\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 115    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n\t 7. With your team, use a board, a piece of paper, or another way of recording your ideas. \na. If you were a team of scientists trying to grow organs from cells, what kind of \nchallenges do you think you would face?\nb. Why do you think it might it be better to use tissue from the living thing to \nreplace organs, rather than another material like a metal or plastic?\n8. Read Cell Culture.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nCell Culture\nBefore you can get the cells in tissues to grow in specific ways, such as to form an \norgan, first you need them to grow! \nIn the early 1950s, scientists were working hard to find ways to culture human \ncells. A cell culture means growing cells outside the body in a lab. There are \nmany challenges when culturing human cells. Usually human cells have \nnutrients, molecules, and oxygen provided by the rest of the body. It was \ndifficult to replace these things and keep human cells growing for a long time \noutside the body.\nScientists were struggling to keep human cell cultures alive, until they got a \nsample of cancerous cells from Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman \nliving in Baltimore, in the United States. Doctors collected the cell sample to \ndiagnose Henrietta, but they also sent some of the sample to a scientist trying to \nculture cells. However, the doctors and researchers did not even ask Henrietta’s \npermission to culture her cells or tell her they would use them for research! \nHenrietta’s cells did well in the laboratory. They kept living and dividing. They \nbecame the first immortal human cell line, known as HeLa cells. HeLa cells \nare still used by scientists today, more than 70 years after they were taken \nfrom Henrietta. Many medical advances, from polio vaccines to artificial \ninsemination, used HeLa cells in their development. Companies have used \nresearch conducted on HeLa cells to create profitable products and techniques. \nHowever, the money these companies made was not shared with Henrietta or \nher family. You can find out more about Henrietta Lacks and her story in the \nBiotechnology! StoryMap.\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 116    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n Emotional Safety Tip\nIt may make you feel sad or angry that Henrietta Lacks had her cells \nused without her consent. It is okay to have these feelings. Sometimes \nwhen you feel sad or angry it can be a good way of noticing things you \nthink are unjust and need to change.\nScientists now have found out a lot about growing cells. They can now grow cells \nthat were taken from your own body. This means a tissue culture in your body \ncould be used to test things specific to you. For example, your tissue culture could \nbe tested with certain treatments to see how the tissues in your body would react. \nSince each person is unique, this might help to match the right treatment to the \nright person. It also could allow new treatments to be tested on a tissue culture \nrather than on animals.\nFigure 3-15: Tissue culture flasks in a laboratory.\nCulturing tissues from your body is also an important step when using those \ntissues to form an organ, if you need one. Scientists are now beginning to use cells \nfrom tissue cultures in 3-D bioprinting. You will find out more about that in the \nnext model experiment.\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 117    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n\t 9. One of the methods scientists are using to make tissues now is 3-D bioprinting. \nDiscuss with your team:\na. Have you ever been around a 3-D printer? Do you know how it works?\nb. Most 3-D printers lay down materials such as plastics in thin layers, slowly \nbuilding up the item over time. How do think this could work with cells?\n 10. Read Modeling 3-D Bioprinting and follow the instructions.\n\t\n\t\nModeling 3-D Bioprinting\nScientists are still working on how to 3-D print organs. In this activity you will be \nusing materials to help you understand how this process might work.\nMaterials\nCircular sprinkles (nonpareils), couscous, sand, or other small, round granules: These \nrepresent the cells that are printed into tissue. The cells are mixed with the bioink \nand go through the nozzle to create the 3-D printed organ. Often, the cells come \nfrom the patient themselves! Other times, they come from a donor. Either way, a few \ncollected cells are cultured to produce the high number required for tissue printing.\nPeanut butter, toothpaste, or a gel-like material of similar consistency: This \nmaterial will represent the bioink. Bioink is a gel that contains water, polymers, \nand often other materials to help the printed object keep its shape. \nSandwich or plastic bags: You can use any thicker plastic bag, but one that seals \nmight work best. The tip of the bag will represent the nozzle of a 3-D bioprinter. \nThe nozzle is where the bioink comes out.\nInstructions\n\t a. Draw a kidney shape on a piece of paper or paper plate. Figure 3-16 has an \nexample of what a kidney shape is. Remember Figure 3-14 and the need for \nkidneys to transplant? You will be modeling what it might be like to 3-D print \na kidney.\nb. To prepare your materials, add your cells (round granules) into your bioink (gel \nmaterial). \n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 118    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t c. Load your bioink and cell mixture into the bag. You’re modeling  loading the \ncell-containing bioink into a 3-D bioprinter.\nd. Cut a very small hole in one corner of your sandwich bag. It should be only a \nfew millimeters wide. This represents the nozzle of a 3-D bioprinter, so only a \nthin stream of bioink should be able to come out.\ne. Plan how you will create the kidney, keeping in mind that 3-D bioprinters \ndeposit ink layer by layer. You may find it helpful to draw a sketch of the layers \nyou plan to print. Figure 3-16 shows an example.\n\t\n\t\n\t f. \nFigure 3-16: Sample model of the 3-D bioprinted kidney activity.\nUse your loaded sandwich bag to print your organ! Remember to work in \nlayers, from bottom to top.\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 119    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n Emotional Safety Tip\nScientists are working on how to 3-D bioprint kidneys and other organs, \nbut they have not yet succeeded with this goal. Every day they are \nlearning more, but if you know someone who needs a new organ, you \nmay feel impatient for this scientific process to progress. It okay to feel \nfrustrated, angry, or sad. Pause and take a break if you need to. \n\t\nRead Bioprinting Challenge and follow the instructions.\nBioprinting Challenge\nPrepare\nIf you want, you can print out and cut up one copy of the Organ Cards from \nFigure 3-17 and four of the Challenge Cards from Figure 3-18. Or you can just \nexamine the cards. If you do not print them, you will need a way to record the \nscores for the Challenge Cards.\nInstructions\n\t a. Gather in a circle with up to four teammates. You will be exploring some of the \nother challenges scientists face when trying to use 3-D bioprinting to create \norgans.\nb. Each Organ Card describes three types of challenges:\n• Cell types: how many different types of cells are part of the organ\n• Structure: how big or complex the organ is\n• Blood vessels: getting blood into and out of the organ to keep all the cells \nalive and healthy (arteries carry blood to an organ, veins carry it away)\nc.

Companies are now using cells to produce pharmaceuticals, beauty products, \nflavorings, biodegradable plastic, and other materials. Scientists can currently print \nskin, bone, blood vessels, corneas (the outermost layer of the eye), ears and other \ncartilage, and even miniature, semi-functional versions of organs (including hearts, \nkidneys, and livers). \nThe technology is moving fast. In this activity however, your job is to slow down and \nthink about any concerns you or others in your community might have about using \nany of these technologies. You can use this information to help your community think \nabout these new technologies.\n\t 1. Take out your Ethical Concerns List from Part 1. \n2. Consider what you learned about using cells in different ways during the Discover \nand Understand activities. Recent advances in biotechnology mean certain \nthings that were impossible in the past may be possible or close to possible now. \nJust because things can be done does not mean they should be done. Does the \nuse of biotransformation, cell culture, or bioprinting raise any of your ethical \nconcerns?\n3. Read Five Whys Instructions.\n\t\n\t\nFive Whys Instructions\n• Break into pairs.\n• Sit facing your partner.\n• Read out one of the prompts from step 4 and have one partner respond with \nhow they feel about it. \n• The other partner should ask them why.\n• The first partner should respond with why they feel this way.\n• Then the other partner should ask why about their explanation.\n• Repeat until the other partner has asked “why” five times.\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 123    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\n\t 4. Use these prompts for your Five Whys exercise. For prompt, have one partner \nshare their opinion about the following situations and have the other partner \nask why.\na. Tissues taken from animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens can be cultured, \njust like the tissue cultures you learned about in the Understand activity. The \nmeat harvested from these tissue cultures is composed of the same type of \ncells as meat from the animal itself, but it is grown in a lab.\nb. Cells used to create products, such as the ones you learned about in the \nDiscover activity, do not need to only be single-celled organisms like yeast \nor bacteria. Plants can be modified to make specific medicines, for example. \nThese plants can be grown in large quantities on farms and then have the \ntarget product extracted.\nc. One scientist decided to change the DNA in human cells. Before birth, human \nDNA was modified to create a person more resistant to disease. Theoretically, \nmodifications to DNA could create people who were stronger, faster, smarter, \nor any one of many traits.\nd. Producing materials that are more sustainable is important, but people also \nmay need to shift to consuming fewer materials in general. Some people \nworry that if more sustainable materials become common, then people will \nnot be motivated to change how much they consume.\n5. Remember your Futures Mood Board from Part 1? Add to or create a new mood \nboard about the use of cells to create things in the future.\na. What are some amazing things that you hope might happen?\nb. What are some things that you are concerned might happen?\n6. Pick one thing you think is either exciting or concerning. Tell another person about \nit. Do they share your perspective? Have a respectful conversation where you \nencourage them to think about why they think the way they do. What do they \nhope will happen with cells and biotechnology in the future?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 3 – Page 124    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 3 Task 2\nCongratulations!\nYou have finished Part 3.\nFind out More!\nFor additional resources and activities, please visit the Biotechnology!

In this task, you will discover more about the way biotechnology \nis used to help diagnose or identify a disease. You will understand how diagnosing \ndisease works by modeling how diseases can be detected using genetic data. Finally, \nyou will act on this information and consider when genetic diseases should be \ndiagnosed.\nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Filippo Pinto e Vairo. Filippo (pronounced FIH-lee-po) \nis one of the many researchers around the world trying to use \nbiotechnology to improve human health and create a healthier \nfuture. As action researchers you are also trying to improve \nhealth in the future. Filippo will be your research mentor to help \nyou understand more about the role biotechnology can play in \ndiagnosing disease.\nFilippo is a clinical geneticist and associate professor at the Mayo Clinic in \nMinnesota, United States. He has a master’s degree in medical sciences and a PhD \nin genetics and molecular biology, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in \nindividualized medicine as well as a specialization in data science. However, he \nalso has knowledge and perspectives that came from other parts of his identity. \nSince Filippo is now working with you, it is important to understand who he is. \nTo help you, Filippo filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Filippo’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• Physician for 15 years, geneticist for 12 years\n• Huge sports (of any kind) fan\n• Enjoys walking, loves traveling \n• Lives in Rochester, Minnesota, USA\n• Born in north Brazil, but lived for 30 years in south Brazil\n• 39 years old\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 135    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n• Male and uses he/his/him pronouns\n• Black hair (“When I had it!”), black eyes, average height\n• Optimistic, good-tempered, curious\n• Speaks Portuguese, English, a little Spanish, and French\n• Interested in genomic and translational medicine\n• Life goal: help diagnose individuals with undiagnosed diseases using state-of-\nthe-art technologies \n• Father of a unique, wonderful daughter\n• Son of a physician and a lawyer\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Filippo’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Filippo? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Filippo? \n• Can you see anything about Filippo’s identity, in addition to his university \ndegrees, that would help him understand different perspectives or ideas about \nhuman health? \nThroughout this task you will notice Filippo sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. He may help you understand better ways to do your research, or share some \nof the research he has done.\nDiscover: What do I know about diagnosing disease?\nYou may think diagnosing diseases is something only doctors do, but really many of \nus diagnose common diseases all the time. In this part we will be talking about two \ndifferent types of diseases. \nOne type is infectious disease, which means you catch a disease from someone or \nsomething. Viruses and bacteria are two common types of microorganisms that can \ncause infectious disease. For example, when someone who is infected with a virus \ncoughs, sometimes that cough pushes small pieces of virus out of their body and into \nthe air, and someone else can be infected by breathing in those small pieces. \nAnother type of disease is genetic disease. Genetic disease occurs when a variation \nwithin a person’s genome causes the disease. You cannot catch a genetic disease. \nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 136    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\nSometimes you inherit, or are born with, the genetic variation that causes the disease. \nOne example of an inherited genetic disease is sickle cell disease. Sometimes you \nacquire, or develop the genetic variation over time, as you grow and your cells divide. \nCancer is one example of an acquired type of genetic disease.\n\t 1. Imagine you and your friends share a meal. Not long afterwards everyone who ate \ntogether begins to feel sick and starts vomiting. Would you have an idea of what \nmight have caused the disease? If so, congratulations! You just made a possible \ndiagnosis. It is very likely you all ate some food that had a harmful microorganism \nthat your body wanted to get rid of, so you started vomiting. This is an example of \nan infectious disease.\n2. Now think about another infectious disease, COVID-19. Share with your team what \nyou know about COVID-19 symptoms, or signs that you might be sick. Which \nCOVID-19 symptoms are you familiar with?\n3. Many of the common symptoms of COVID-19 can also be caused by other \ninfectious diseases. For example, many infectious diseases cause a runny nose, \ncoughing, and fever. With your team, discuss, how you could find out for sure \nwhether someone with these symptoms has COVID-19 or another illness.\n4. After you have discussed how to diagnose someone with COVID-19 symptoms, \nread Testing for COVID.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nTesting for COVID\nThere are two common types of tests to diagnose someone with COVID-19.\nOne is called an antigen test. The antigen test is often taken at home. Sometimes \nit is called a rapid test because it can give results in around 15 minutes. The \nCOVID-19 virus has specific antigens, or proteins, that are unique to the virus. \nThe COVID-19 antigen test contains a substance that reacts when the antigen \nis present. So if enough of the virus is in your body, it reacts with the substance \nin the test and often signals the presence of the antigen by turning a color. \nFigure 4-1 shows an example.\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 137    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFigure 4-1: This is a positive antigen COVID-19 test. A line at the C (control) shows the test is working.  \nA line at the T (test) shows the test is positive and the protein antigen of COVID-19 is present.\nThe other common COVID-19 test is called a PCR test. PCR is a biotechnology \ntechnique that creates many copies of existing genetic material. The PCR \ntechnique can be used in many ways. In the case of the COVID-19 PCR test, if the \nCOVID-19 viral genetic materials are present, the PCR creates many copies, so they \nare easy to detect. \n Emotional Safety Tip\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected people’s health and lives. You may \nhave been sick yourself or have had friends or family who were sick or \ndied from COVID-19. Thinking about this may be upsetting. If you need \nto pause and take a break, that is okay.\n5. Have you or someone else you know ever been tested for COVID -19? If you feel \ncomfortable doing so, share that experience with your teammates.\na. Which type of test do you think was used?\nb. Was it useful to have the results of the test? Why or why not?\nc. Have you ever known anyone who had trouble having their disease \ndiagnosed?\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 138    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\nFilippo says . . . \nDiagnosis is so important. For example, if a newborn is very sick, \nit could be an infection. But it could be a genetic disease. And if \nyou can diagnose this child, you can offer the right treatment, \nthe right medicine, the right diet. You can save lives, and we are \ndoing this. When you sequence the genome of a newborn that \nis ill in the intensive care unit, you find a genetic answer 50% to \n60% of the time.\n\t 6. Read Genetic Variation and Diseases. \nGenetic Variation and Diseases\nAs you read before, infectious diseases like COVID-19 are only one type of disease. \nAnother type of disease is genetic. When cells grow and divide, the DNA in the \ncells is copied. During this copying process there is a chance of making errors. \nThese errors may delete, insert, or change a portion of DNA. These errors are \nsometimes called mutations. These mutations create genetic variants, or genes \nwith one or more differences from the original. \nYou inherit some genetic variants from your parents when you are born. You \nalso continue to acquire genetic variants throughout your life as your DNA is \ncopied when your cells divide. Other things can also cause mutations and genetic \nvariants, like exposure to tobacco, certain chemicals, radiation, ultraviolet light, \nand certain viruses.\nNot all mutations are harmful; many do not have any effect at all. Your body has \nmany ways of identifying and getting rid of cells that do have harmful mutations.\nHowever, sometimes people inherit DNA that has harmful variants. Often this \nmatters more in some cells than in others. For example, in the genetic disease \ncystic fibrosis, the genetic variant is in all the person’s cells, but is particularly \nharmful in cells in the lungs and intestines.\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 139    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\nPeople also acquire harmful variants. If a cell that has harmful variants is not \nidentified and removed by the body, it can continue to divide. This means all the \ncells that come from those cell divisions will almost always also have the harmful \nvariants. This uncontrolled growth of cells with harmful variants is called cancer. \nCancers usually start in one area of the body, like the liver, brain, or stomach.\n Emotional Safety Tip\nYou or someone you care about may suffer from an inherited or acquired \ngenetic disease. This is not your or their fault. It is okay to feel sad, \nfrustrated, or upset. If you need to pause and take a break, that is okay.\nFilippo says . . . \nThere is no such thing as a normal genome. Everyone has \ngenetic variants when compared to a so-called reference \ngenome. I am different from you in part because we have \ngenetic variants. What clinicians and researchers do is to find \nout if there are specific genetic variants that are causing a \npatient’s symptoms.\n\t 7. Now, with a partner, think about genetic disease. Often these diseases are caused \nby just one small variation in the base pair DNA sequence of a gene. For example, \nif an A base changes to a C base, this variation can create problems building the \nprotein for which the gene usually codes. How could you diagnose this disease? \nConsider the biotechnology tools you have learned about here and in Part 1 (they \nare listed below). Pick the tool or tools you think might be useful to diagnose an \ninherited genetic disease. Explain to your partner how you think that might work.\na. Genome sequencing, a tool that allows you to find out the order of all the \nDNA bases in the cell\nb. CRISPR, a tool that allows you to change specific parts of a DNA sequence in \na cell\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 140    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t c. Antigen test, a tool that reacts to specific proteins\nd. PCR test, a tool that makes lots of copies of a specific part of DNA\n\t\nFigure 4-2: A genome sequencing result.\n\t 8. One common way genetic diseases are diagnosed is through genome sequencing. \nThere are certain genetic variations that are known to be linked to genetic disease. \nIf you have one of these variations and you have the symptoms of the disease, it is \nlikely the genetic variation is causing the disease. As you learned in Part 1, genome \nsequencing is getting more inexpensive all the time. Discuss with your teammates:\na. What are the advantages to having affordable and available genome \nsequencing?\nb. Are there any disadvantages?\n\t\n\t\nFilippo says . . . \nMany patients have been searching for a diagnosis for a long \ntime. Even when you give them news that is not good, it can be \nhelpful. They can get some closure. They can start to find other \nsimilar patients and think about their options. When you are in \nthe dark [without a diagnosis] it is just difficult to do anything.\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 141    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\nUnderstand: How can biotechnology determine the specific causes of disease?\nGenome sequencing can help medical researchers find out more about whether a \ngenetic disease is causing specific symptoms. Though everyone is born with dozens \nto hundreds of new variants, many of these variants do not create problems. But some \nspecific variants of human genes have already been identified as often leading to \ndisease. The difficulty is in determining which variants may be causing the symptoms \nof a genetic disease.\n\t 1. Clinicians and medical researchers are like disease detectives. They are trying to \nwork backwards from the symptoms to the cause of a disease. Sometimes they \ncan do this by looking at things people with specific symptoms have in common. \nOne of the things people may have in common is the same genetic variant.\n2. Read and follow the Disease Detective Instructions to become a disease detective \nyourself.\n\t\nDisease Detective Instructions\nThese are the steps clinicians and medical researchers use when they are trying to \nfind the cause of a disease.\n\t a. Examine the symptoms: When searching for a genetic cause of a disease, the \nfirst thing researchers usually examine is a person’s symptoms. If others have \nsimilar symptoms and a genetic cause is known, that genetic cause might be \nthe first place to investigate.\nb. Decide which part of the genome to sequence: If a specific genetic \nvariation is suspected to be the cause of the disease, sometimes only one \ngene is sequenced. However, as genetic sequencing is becoming more \naffordable, researchers often will sequence a person’s whole genome.\nc. Analyze the genome: Researchers have created something called a reference \ngenome using the most common DNA sequences they collected. They use \ncomputers to compare the DNA sequences of the patient with sequences \nfrom the reference genome. They analyze large amounts of data to identify \nvariants. Variants can be due to several causes.\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 142    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t\n• Deletion: A variant can have one or more base pairs deleted. For example, \nif the reference sequence was ACTAGAG but the patient had the sequence \nAAGAG, the base pairs CT were deleted.\n• Insertion: A variant can have one or more base pairs inserted, or added. For \nexample, if the reference sequence was ACTAGAG and the patient had the \nsequence ATCTAGAG, the base pair T was inserted right after the first A.\n• Substitution: A variant can have one or more base pairs substituted. For \nexample, if the reference sequence was ACTAGAG and the patient had the \nsequence CCTAGAG, the base pair C was substituted for the first base pair A.\n\t d. Match the variant to the disease: If other people in the population have the \nsame variant and the same symptoms, that is a good clue that the variant may \nbe causing the disease.\n3. Now you can try to be a disease detective yourself, using the same steps.\n Emotional Safety Tip\nThere has been a lot of progress in diagnosing and treating genetic \ndiseases, but still, if you know someone with one of these diseases you \nmay be worried about them. Even if you don’t know someone personally, \nlearning about diseases can feel hard and scary. It is okay to pause and \ntake a break if you need to. \n\t 4. Examine the symptoms: Use the clues in the following steps to help identify the \ncause of the patient’s symptoms.\na. Patient A symptoms: persistent coughing, frequent respiratory infections, \nwheezing, salty-tasting skin\n5. Decide which part of the genome to sequence: Figure 4-3 shows four common \ngenetic diseases and the genes that have been linked to those diseases. Which \ngene do you think you should sequence for Patient A?\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 143    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t\nTay-Sachs Disease\nSymptoms: weakness, difficulty \nswallowing, loss of hearing or vision\nLinked gene: HEXA (hexosaminidase A)\nSickle Cell Disease\nSymptoms: anemia (lack of red blood \ncells), periods of pain, swelling of hands \nand feet, delayed growth\nLinked gene: HBB (hemoglobin-beta-locus)\nCystic Fibrosis\nSymptoms: frequent coughing and \nlung infections, shortness of breath and \nwheezing, poor growth, salty skin\nLinked gene: CFTR (cystic fibrosis \ntransmembrance conductance regulator)\nHemochromatosis\nSymptoms: feeling tired, pain in joints, \ndarkening of skin\nLinked gene: HFE (homeostatic iron \nregulator)\nFigure 4-3: Symptoms and linked genes of four genetic diseases.\n6. Analyze the genome: Let’s assume you decided to sequence the CFTR gene that \nis linked with cystic fibrosis. The CFTR gene has almost 200,000 base pairs. A \ncomputer gives you another clue and identifies one place in the CFTR gene in \nPatient A that is variant, meaning it is different than the reference sequence. \n\t a. Can you find the variant in patient A? Remember, the variant could be a \ndeletion of one or more base pairs, an insertion of one or more base pairs, or a \nsubstitution of one or more base pairs.\nReference CFTR partial sequence:\t   AAAATATCATCTTTGGTGTTT\nPatient A CFTR partial sequence:\t\n  AAAATATCATTGGTGTTT\n\t 7. Match the variant to the disease: The CFTR gene codes for the CFTR protein, which \nis usually part of the cell membrane. The CFTR protein helps maintain the balance \nbetween salt and water within and outside of cells. There are many variants that \ncan cause a problem with the CFTR protein, and those variants can cause cystic \nfibrosis. Figure 4-4 shows three common CFTR variants.\n\t a. Which variant do you think Patient A has? \n\t b. Would you diagnose Patient A with cystic fibrosis?\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 144    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t\nCFTR Variant Name\nCFTR Variant Description\nP.Phe508del \nThis variant is the deletion of three base pairs (CTT), which \nresults in a protein missing one amino acid. This protein does \nnot get properly folded and so is not usable.\nP.Gly542* \nThis variant is caused by a substitution of a G for a T. This \nsubstitution stops the protein from adding the remaining \namino acids and the protein is not usable.\np.Asn1303Lys \nThis variant is caused by the substitution of a C for a G. This \nchanges the amino acid asparagine to the amino acid lysine. \nThe stops the protein from functioning correctly.\nFigure 4-4: Three common CFTR variants and their effects in the body.1\n8. Read Patient A Diagnosis to find out if you diagnosed Patient A correctly.\nPatient A Diagnosis\nIf you thought the symptoms of patient A matched the symptoms of cystic fibrosis \nand so you should test the CFTR gene, you are right. \nThe reference sequence had three base pairs (shown in bold) that were deleted in \nPatient A’s CFTR gene: AAAATATCATCTTTGGTGTTTGG. \nThe scientific name of this variant is P.Phe508del and it is the most common \ncause of cystic fibrosis globally. Once the variant is identified, scientists can start \nthinking about how to fix the genetic problem. You will learn more about this in \nTask 2.\nBecause cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease, certain variants can be more or \nless common among different populations. For example, in many parts of Europe \nmore than 70% of cystic fibrosis patients have the P.Phe 508del variant. However, \nin Turkey only around 20% of cystic fibrosis patients have this variant. Your genetic \ninheritance from your biological parents, grandparents, and so on is called your \nancestry. Your ancestry is important when thinking about genetic diseases.\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 145    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t 9. Most reference sequences were built by gathering DNA from people with \nEuropean ancestry and finding their most common base pair sequences. Discuss \nwith your team:\na. Why might that be a problem for identifying whether a variant is causing a \ndisease if the patient does not have European ancestry?\nb. How could gathering reference sequences from people with other ancestries \nhelp scientists better diagnose disease? \n 10. Not all genetic diseases are caused by a problem with just one gene. Read what \nFilippo has to say. How might having multiple genes that cause a disease change \nwhat you need to do to diagnose it?\n\t\n\t\nFilippo says . . . \nWith some diseases it is a single gene causing a single disease. \nThis is straightforward. But this is not always the case. For \nexample, with epilepsy there are multiple genes involved. Every \nsingle day we are discovering new genes that cause epilepsy. \nThe sequencing technology has developed a lot. With next-\ngeneration sequencing we can sequence the entire genome \nmore quickly and affordably. Then we can search for variants in thousands of \ngenes at a time—even ones we didn’t know caused epilepsy, for example.\nAct: How can we use this information ethically and wisely?\nNot everyone wants to know everything about their health. It is the nature of genetics \nthat when a person finds out things about their health, they sometimes find out \ninformation they did not want to know. They may also find out about potential health \nproblems of their relatives. Often before a genetic test is done, a genetic counselor \nwill help people think through what it will mean to have this knowledge. In this \nactivity you will think about the questions you might raise if you were a genetic \ncounselor.\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 146    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t 1. Imagine you are a genetic counselor. What are some of the things you think might \nbe very important to think about before being tested for a genetic variant?\n2. Write down questions you might like to ask or topics to raise with someone \nmaking this choice. What should they think about?\n3. Examine your Ethical Concerns List from Part 1. If anything on the list reminds you \nof any questions you might like to ask or ideas you would want the patient to think \nabout, write down those ideas now.\n\t\n\t\nFilippo says . . . \nWe are now using genetic testing in all sorts of different ways. \nWe are testing people who are healthy who want to know if \nthey are likely to develop a genetic disease or if they might \npass a genetic disease on to their children. So we are now using \ngenome testing not just for diagnosis, but also to help people \nplan and make decisions.\n\t 4. With a partner, read Situation One. \nSituation One\nPeople with certain genetic variants in the BRCA1 gene have a higher risk of \ndeveloping breast cancer. This is true for men and women. Just because you have \na BRCA1 variant does not mean you will develop breast cancer; it is just more \nlikely. \nOthers in your family have had breast cancer. You are considering testing for \nBRCA1 variants. However, your sister does not want to know whether she has \na BRCA1 variant. Although her genetic results could be different, if you tested \npositive, it would mean she could have as much as a 50% chance of testing \npositive as well. Do you want to have a BRCA1 genetic test?\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 147    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t 5. Assign one partner to be a genetic counselor and the other to be a patient in \nSituation One.\na. As the genetic counselor, use the questions you wrote down and any others \nyou can think of to encourage the patient to think about the potential \nconsequences of their decision. Your role is not to judge them or make them \ndecide a certain way; it is to help them consider all the different parts and \nconsequences of their decision. For example, you might ask, “Why are you \nconsidering getting the BRCA1 genetic test?” \nb. As the patient, think about how you might feel if you were in Situation One. \nTry to answer the genetic counselor’s questions. If the information is not \nprovided, for example if there are questions about why your sister does \nnot want to know, you can just use your imagination to make up realistic \ninformation. For example, you could say, “I am thinking about getting the \ntest because I just had a friend who was diagnosed late with breast cancer \nand it has been hard to treat” or, “I am thinking about getting the test \nbecause I believe it is better to know than not know,” or another reason that \nyou decide.\n6. Now switch. The partner who was the genetic counselor becomes the patient. The \npartner who was the patient becomes the genetic counselor. Use the information \nin Situation Two to role play another discussion, the same way you did in step 5.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nSituation Two\nYour parent had a genetic disease that affects the brain called Huntington’s \ndisease. A person is born with the variant that causes the disease, but the \nsymptoms do not develop until middle age. People with symptoms usually have \nproblems with thinking, behavior, and movement that get worse over a period of \n10 to 25 years. \nThere is currently no cure for this disease. If your parent had it, you have a 50% \nchance of inheriting this disease. Do you want to have a genetic test to find out \nwhether you inherited Huntington’s disease?\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 148    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 1\n\t\n Emotional Safety Tip\nHaving conversations about whether you would or would not test for a \ndisease can feel emotional, especially if you know someone with a genetic \ndisease. There are no right or wrong answers, and every person and \nsituation is unique. If you need to pause and take a break, that is okay.\n7. Discuss with your team:\na. Why might it be important to have conversations like those you modeled with \nthe genetic counselor before testing?\nb. As testing becomes more common, are there things you think people need to \nbe talking about more frequently?\nc. Some people are able to access genetic testing. Others may not be in a \nlocation that offers genetic testing or genetic testing may be too expensive for \nthem. How do you feel about that?\n8. Write or draw the important things you want to remember and share about \ndiagnosing genetic disease. Be sure to include:\na. How it works\nb. The types of diseases can be diagnosed\nc. What is useful about testing to diagnose genetic diseases\nd.  What are the potential concerns\ne. Why this might be important to your community\n9. Share this information with a classmate, friend, or family member. Discuss with \nthem why it might be important to know this information.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 149    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\nTask 2: How can we fix genetic diseases using \nbiotechnology? \nIn Task 1, you explored how to diagnose genetic diseases. Gene therapy is one \ntype of treatment to fix genetic problems. Using gene therapy, genes can be added \nor changed to treat genetic diseases. Today the dream of gene therapy is rapidly \nbecoming a reality. In this task you will discover the need for targeted treatments to \nfix genetic problems. Then you will investigate to understand how biotechnology is \nhelping to deliver personalized treatments. Finally, you will act by integrating what \nyou now know into community dialogues about treating disease.\nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Nicole Paulk. Nicole (pronounced nih-COLE) is one \nof the many researchers around the world trying to use \nbiotechnology to improve human health and create a healthier \nfuture. As action researchers you are also trying to improve \nhealth in the future. Nicole will be your research mentor to help \nyou understand more about the role biotechnology can play in \ntreating disease.\nNicole is a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California, \nSan Francisco, in the United States. She has a PhD in viral gene therapy and \ncompleted a postdoctoral fellowship in human gene therapy. However, she also \nhas knowledge and perspectives that came from other parts of her identity. Since \nNicole is now working with you, it is important to understand who she is. \nTo help you, Nicole filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Nicole’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• Lives in San Francisco, California\n• 38 years old\n• White/Caucasian female\n• Interested in viruses, gene therapy, and genome engineering\n• Likes to snowboard, cycle, go on adventure vacations, and go white-water \nrafting\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 150    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\n\t\n• “Tall, hazel eyes, long straight brown hair that won’t curl no matter WHAT I do to \nit, huge smile”\n• Loud voice, goofy, detail-oriented\n• Daughter of a lumberjack and a secretary, sister to an electrician\n• Life goal: help discover treatments for diseases that have no therapies, \nparticularly for diseases in kids\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Nicole’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Nicole? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Nicole? \n• Can you see anything about Nicole’s identity, in addition to her university \ndegrees, that would help her understand different perspectives or ideas about \nhuman health? \nThroughout this task you will notice Nicole sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. She may help you understand better ways to do your research or share some \nof the research she has done.\nDiscover: How can we treat genetic diseases?\nDNA is like an instruction manual for your cells. When there are errors with the \ninstructions, there can be problems with your cells and your body. In Task 1 you \nlearned about how researchers are diagnosing these errors. In this activity you will \nstart thinking about treatments to fix these errors.\n\t 1. Use a class board or a piece of paper to list diseases you know about. These can be \ndiseases you or others you know have had or just diseases you have heard about. \nIf you have time, you can ask others you know, like your family or friends, for \nadditional ideas.\n2. Now list any treatments you know next to each disease. Treatments might include \npills, injections, surgery, or other methods.\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 151    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\n\t 3. With your team, discuss:\na. Do these treatments fix the cause of the problem or just make someone feel \nbetter for a while? It is okay if you do not know the answer to this question. \nJust do your best.\nb. Are these treatments targeted to one specific place in the body or do they go \nall over the body?\nc. How do the treatments reach the part of the body they are trying to treat?\n4. Examine your list of diseases and treatments. Circle the diseases you think might \nbe caused by problems with your genes. Next you will be thinking about the way \ngene therapy tries to treat genetic problems.\n5. Read this analogy, then answer the questions with your team. \n6. You know that a cell uses the instructions in DNA to build proteins. Let’s imagine \nyou are like a cell and are trying to build something. In this analogy you are trying \nto build a chair just like the one in Figure 4-5. What would you need? \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFigure 4-5: The chair you are trying to build in the analogy.\n\t 7. You might think you need materials to build the chair and instructions on how to \nbuild it. This is true for a cell as well when it is building a protein. It needs materials \nto build the protein, and it also needs instructions. Where does the cell get its \ninstructions?\n8. The cell gets its instructions from DNA, just like you might get your instructions \nfrom an instruction manual. Imagine the instructions have an error. Maybe a \nsentence or a whole page is missing. Or perhaps the instructions were printed \n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 152    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\nwrong and tell you to attach a piece backwards. Or maybe there are extra steps \nprinted that should not be there.\na.  With your team, think about how an error in your instruction manual might be \nan analogy for an error with the DNA instructions in a cell.\nb. Are there different types of errors possible in DNA, just as there were with your \ninstruction manual?\nc. What do you think might happen when building a protein if there was an error \nin the DNA that codes for it?\n9. Read DNA Instructions and disease.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nDNA Instructions and Disease\nWithout all the correct instructions, you might not be able to build the chair so \nthat it is usable. And without all the correct base pairs in a gene, a cell might not \nbe able to build a usable protein. When a cell cannot build a usable protein, this \ncan cause a disease. Diagnosing the problem means finding the place in the \ninstructions that is creating the problem. You learned about this in Task 1. Now \nyou will think about how to fix this problem.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 153    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\nGene Therapy Types\nThere are different approaches to treating genetic diseases. \nSometimes, a whole new copy of an existing gene is added to a cell and then \nusable proteins can be made, along with the unusable ones from the existing \nvariant gene. This would be like having a whole new set of instructions delivered \nso you could build the chair. This is called gene replacement therapy.\nGenes can also be directly edited within the genome, using a tool like CRISPR. This \nwould be like someone arriving at your home and using a pen to fix the error in \nyour instruction manual. This is called gene editing therapy.\nSometimes, a gene that is supposed to be switched off and not make proteins \ngets switched on by a variant. This would be like if you had an additional step in \nyour instruction manual. Someone could come to your home and use a marker \nto cross out the extra step. In the case of gene therapy, a gene that blocks that \nvariant gene from building proteins might be introduced. This is called gene \ninhibition therapy.\nNicole says . . . \nA genetic medicine can either be something that’s permanent \nor something that’s temporary. It can be something where \nwe edit your genome. For example, if you were born with \na mutation in one of your really important genes, we could \nactually go in and fix that mutation in place so you wouldn’t \nhave that mutation anymore. Or we could give you a whole \nfunctional copy of a gene.\n\t\nDelivering the gene therapy is another challenge. Think again about the analogy. \nEven though the correct instructions for the chair may exist, that doesn’t help \nyou unless you have them at your home. Imagine you need a physical copy of the \ncorrect instruction manual to build the chair. Someone reading it to you over the \nphone or sending you an electronic copy will not do. The company that produces \nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 154    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\nthe guide is far away, but they do have correct copies. How could you get a copy of \nthe missing step at your home?\na. When something is delivered to your home, what kind of information do \nyou think is necessary so the delivery person can get it to you—not to your \nneighbor, a person across the country, or a person across the world?\nb. Why do you think it might be important to target the delivery of a gene \ntherapy to a specific cell (or cells)?\n\t\n\t\nNicole says . . . \nThe delivery of the gene therapy needs to be specific, just like \na delivery truck delivers to a specific place, not just go to your \ncountry or your state. The delivery has to go to your street, to \nyour building, right to your door.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nUnderstand: How can biotechnology help provide targeted treatments?\nThe goal of gene therapy is to target the specific problem with the gene in the specific \ncells where it is a problem. This can be challenging, but scientists have made tremendous \nprogress.\n\t 1. Think about ways you could deliver gene therapy to specific cells and share your \nideas with your team. You need to:\na. Protect the genetic material you are trying to deliver \nb. Deliver genetic material to the cell\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 155    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\n\t c. Make sure the genetic material enters the cell you want, also known as the \ntarget cell \n2. Now, with your team, read Special Delivery. What natural systems already target \nand deliver genetic material to cells?\n\t\nSpecial Delivery\nViruses can be very good at entering and infecting cells. Think of the virus as like \nthe delivery vehicle from the Discover analogy. How could this be useful?\nUsually, viruses contain their own genetic material that they carry into a cell when \nthey enter it. However, imagine all the viral genetic material was removed. Only \nthe parts needed for delivery remain. This virus delivery vehicle is called a viral \nvector. The viral vector can now deliver lots of different things. For example, you \ncould add a gene for gene therapy to the virus and have it delivered to the cell. \nViruses are not the only gene therapy delivery vehicles, but they are by far the \nmost common. Different viruses are selected for different needs.\n\t 3. Think about a viral infection you have had (such as a cold or the flu). Did the \nvirus tend to attack certain places in your body? Some viruses tend to infect the \nrespiratory system, others the digestive system, others may infect other types of \ncells. So most viruses are already targeting specific cell types. Why might that be \nuseful when using them as a delivery mechanism?\nNicole says . . . \nPeople usually think of viruses as something that we treat, for \nexample if you’re sick with a virus. But in fact the vast majority \nof viruses on the planet don’t make humans sick. They can be \nused as delivery tools. Different viruses tend to go different \nplaces. Viruses are already really good at getting inside of our \ncells, so we can use a virus to deliver the gene therapy. \nWe can also custom tailor viruses in all kinds of ways to make them more targeted \nto a particular spot in your body, or to a particular species, or to a particular \ncombination of tissues or cell types.\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 156    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\n\t 4. Divide up into groups of three. Each member of the group will need a pencil and a \npiece of paper. Read Modeling Gene Therapies Instructions.\nModeling Gene Therapies Instructions\nAs a group you are going to model how different types of gene therapy work once \nthey reach the target cells. \nRemember when you learned that a cell can “read” DNA to build proteins? In Part \n1 we used the analogy of the sentence, “Start here: Read this sentence and then \ndraw a box” as an analogy for how DNA gives cells instructions. In this activity you \nwill use this analogy to model how different gene therapies work.\nChoose one person to model the cell, one person to model the current gene, and \none person to model the gene therapy. \nThe cell\nIf you are modeling the cell, your job is to follow the instructions you receive. Cells \nalways need to be told to start reading a piece of DNA. So, as long as you receive \nan instruction begins with “Start here” you will carry out the instruction. Use a \npiece of paper and pencil to draw anything you are told to draw.\nThe current gene\nIf you are representing the current gene, you write instructions on the top of your \npiece of paper. Tear off that part of the paper and give it to the cell to carry out. If the \ngene therapy replaces or changes your piece of paper, you should let them do it.\nThe gene therapy \nIf you are representing the gene therapy, your goal is to make sure the cell is \ndrawing what is needed. In this model you will have three options:\n\t a.\tGene Replacement: Write down instructions on an additional piece of paper \nand give them to the cell to carry out. The current gene will then give your \npiece of paper to the cell. \nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 157    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\n\t b.\tGene Editing: Take your pencil and correct a few letters that were mutated in \nthe current gene. Have the current gene give their corrected instructions to \nthe cell. \n\t c.\tGene Inhibition: Take your pencil and cross out what the current gene has \nwritten so it cannot be read. Have the current gene give their crossed-out \ninstructions to the cell. \nThere will be four rounds. Have the current gene and the gene therapy read the \ndetails for each round. Hide the details from the cell. Can the gene therapy find a \nway to get the cell to meet the goal?\nRound 1\nGoal: Have the cell draw a circle.\nCurrent gene: Begin by writing the sentence, “Start here: Read this sentence and \nthen draw a circle” on your piece of paper. Now you will model the mutation. Erase \nthe word “circle” and substitute in the word “line.” Your paper should now read, \n“Start here: Read this sentence and then draw a line.”\nGene therapy: Use the type of therapy you think would be best to achieve your \ngoal of getting the cell to draw a circle.\nRound 2\nGoal: Have the cell draw a big triangle and then a small triangle.\nCurrent gene: Begin by writing the sentence, “Start here: Read this sentence and \nthen draw a big triangle and then a small triangle” on your piece of paper. Now \nyou will model the variant. Erase the part that says, “and then a small triangle.” \nGene therapy: Use the type of therapy you think would be best to achieve your goal.\nRound 3\nGoal: Have the cell draw nothing.\nCurrent gene: Begin by writing the sentence “Start here: Read this sentence” \non your piece of paper. Now you will model the variant. After “sentence” add \nthe words, “and then draw squares until the paper is filled.” Your paper should \nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 158    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\n\t\nnow read: “Start here: Read this sentence and then draw squares until the paper \nis filled.”\nGene therapy: Use the type of therapy you think would be best to achieve \nyour goal.\nRound 4\nGoal: Have the cell draw a square.\nCurrent gene: Begin by writing the sentence, “Start here: Read this sentence and \ndraw a square” on your piece of paper. Now you will model the variant. Erase \neverything between “Start” and “square.” Your paper should now read: “Start \nsquare.”\nGene therapy: Use the type of therapy you think would be best to achieve \nyour goal.\n\t 5. Discuss with your group:\na. Why were some gene therapies better than others for the different situations \nin the different rounds?\nb. Could you have used other ones? For example, if the gene therapy you chose \nwas gene replacement, could you have used gene editing instead?\n\t\n\t\n Emotional Safety Tip\nAlthough scientists have made a lot of progress and the first gene \ntherapies are starting to be available to the public, there is a long way \nto go. Many gene therapies are only in the testing phase and many more \nare still in development. It can be frustrating if you or someone you care \nabout is suffering from a disease that might be cured or helped using \ngene therapy, but the therapy is not yet available. It is okay to feel sad \nor angry about that. By learning about how gene therapy works, you can \nhelp educate others and encourage the changes you want.\n6. Read what Nicole says. How do you think gene therapy will change things in the \nfuture?\nBiotechnology!     Part 4 – Page 159    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 4 Task 2\nNicole says . . . \nA virus can now be a therapeutic drug to treat you for \nsomething. For example, there are kids who are unable to see \nbecause they are born with a specific type of blindness that is \ncaused by a problem with one of their genes. We can give them \na one-time infusion of a virus into their eye that gives them a \nfunctioning gene that they weren’t born with—a gene they \nneeded to see. Then, once they wake up from the surgery, they can see. And they \ncan see forever. We can cure this form of blindness using gene therapy.\nRight now a lot of the gene therapy work is on rare diseases, but work is starting \non even more common ones. I think in the future there will be gene therapies \nfor diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. If you are in middle or high \nschool now, I feel certain that you will be eligible for a gene therapy within your \nlifetime. It will become a common type of treatment. \n\t 7. You have learned more about the way gene therapy works. Now choose a \ndisease you know about in your community. You will be doing some research to \ninvestigate whether there are any ongoing clinical trials using gene therapy to \ntreat that disease. A clinical trial is the final stage of developing a treatment. If a \ntreatment appears to be working and to be safe in laboratory and other models, \nit usually is tested next with a small group of people. If those people have good \nresults, it gets tested with even larger groups. If you have access to the Internet, \nyou can go to trialsearch.who.int or clinicaltrials.gov to search for clinical trials that \nare happening right now. Search for the name of the disease you are investigating \nand gene therapy. \na. How many clinical trials are underway?\nb. How recent are the clinical trials?\n8. Compare your results with your teammates. \na. Which disease did you find has the most gene therapy clinical trials?\nb.

The genetic data of your genome \ncan tell researchers many things about you. This is true for humans and all living \nthings. In this task you will discover more about what we can learn from DNA. Then \nyou will investigate to understand more about how people in your community feel \nabout sharing this information. Finally, you will act to decide how you think genetic \ndata should be protected.\nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Kadija Ferryman. Kadija (pronounced kah-DEE-jah) is \none of the many researchers around the world thinking about \nhow to use biotechnology ethically. \nKadija is a professor of bioethics and health policy at Johns \nHopkins University in the United States. She has a PhD \nin anthropology. However, she also has knowledge and \nperspectives that came from other parts of her identity. Since Kadija is now \nworking with you, it is important to understand who she is. \nTo help you, Kadija filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Kadija’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• Jamaican-American, or “Jamerican”\n• Both of my parents were born and raised in Jamaica, as well as all of my \nancestors going back to the 1790s.\n• Woman\n• Native New Yorker; born and raised in New York City\n• BA from Yale University, PhD from the New School for Social Research\n• Interested in how we understand differences between human groups, digital \ntechnologies, justice and fairness in society\n• Likes Caribbean and African diasporic dance, cooking, jogging, listening to \npodcasts, cycling, spending time with family and friends\n• Has been wearing glasses since the fourth grade\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 171    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Kadija’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Kadija? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Kadija? \n• Can you see anything about Kadija’s identity, in addition to her university \ndegrees, that would help her understand different perspectives or ideas about \nthe ethics of using genetic data? \nThroughout this task you will notice Kadija sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. She may help you understand better ways to do your research or share some \nof the research she has done.\nDiscover: What can we learn from DNA?\nEvery person’s genome is unique. It contains information that determines parts of your \nidentity. There are many different ways this information can be used.\n\t 1. Take out your Identity Map from Part 1.\n2. Examine it carefully. Find any parts of your identity that you think might be related \nto your DNA. For example, your identity map may include physical characteristics \ndetermined by your DNA. Or your identity map may include roles you play based \non shared genetic relationships, such as daughter or brother. \n3. Discuss with your team:\na. Which parts of your identity do you think could be found in your DNA?\nb. Which parts of your identity are not found in your DNA? \nc. Can your DNA tell your story? Does your DNA leave out important parts of \nwhat make you you?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n Emotional Safety Tip\nYour genetics can affect who you are but they do not determine all parts \nof your identity. Sometimes people may assume certain things about you \nbased on your genetics. But you are the one who decides who you are.\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 172    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 4. Think quietly to yourself: \na. Are there ever parts of your identity that you want to keep private?\nb. How would you feel if other people could find out that information using your \nDNA?\n5. Gather with your team. You will be investigating more about how genetic data is \ncollected and analyzed. Read Collecting the Sample.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nCollecting the Sample\nThe first step to using genetic data is to collect a sample of DNA. DNA can be found \nin every cell in your body. It can be found in your hair, sweat, blood, urine (pee), \nfeces (poop), saliva (spit), and even little flakes of your skin that you leave behind.\n\t 6. With your team, discuss:\na. Where might you have left samples of your DNA without realizing it? Make a \nlist of all the places you can think of.\nb. Would you be comfortable if these samples were used to find more \ninformation about you? \n7. Read Analyzing the Sample.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nAnalyzing the Sample\nAfter collection, the DNA in the sample needs to be sequenced so the genetic \ndata can be analyzed. Researchers use chemicals to extract DNA, just as you \ndid in Part 1. Then researchers can use a DNA sequencing machine to find out \nthe sequence of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs. This sequence is then sent to a computer for \nanalysis and interpretation. Figure 5-1 shows an example.\nFigure 5-1: A DNA molecule is collected in a sample tube and sequenced in a machine, which then \nsends the data to a computer for analysis.\nPart 5 Task 1\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 173    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nYou may remember from Part 1 that scientists sequenced the whole human \ngenome as part of the Human Genome Project. At that time, scientists had to \nsequence all the DNA in order, like reading a book from start to finish. It took a \nlong time. Now scientists have found a quicker way to sequence DNA called next-\ngeneration sequencing. They sequence many parts of the DNA at the same time. \nThen they use a computer to reassemble the pieces in order. Humans share 99.9% \nof our DNA, so as long as there is enough of a part, it is straightforward to see \nwhere it fits into the sequence of the genome. Scientists use a reference genome, \nor an example of a living thing’s genome, to help them understand the order of \nthe DNA pieces.\n\t 8. Discuss with your team:\na. How did the Human Genome Project make it easier to sequence genomes of \nother humans?\nb. There is now something called the Pan Genome Project in which scientists are \ntrying to sequence the genomes of all living things. Why might this be useful?\n9. Now that you have a DNA sequence, you need to discover what it means. Read \nUsing the Clues. Can you figure out whose DNA you collected?\n\t\n\t\n\t\nUsing the Clues\nGenetic data is often used by researchers to identify which living thing left behind \na sample of their DNA. Genetic data can tell us a lot about the species or individual \nwho left it behind. Researchers analyze the genetic data to find out more about \nthe living thing it came from. \nWho does the DNA belong to?\nImagine you are a researcher who collected a sample of DNA and wants to find \nout who the DNA belongs to. For this activity we will use a set of imaginary \nmonsters. As a researcher, can you use the genetic data from genes A, B, C, and D \nin the collected sample to identify the monster who left it behind?\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 174    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFigure 5-2: Imaginary monster genes.\nWhich monster did the DNA come from?\nFigure 5-3: Imaginary monsters.\n\t\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 175    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nKadija says . . . \nAfter sequencing the human genome, we found that all \nhumans are 99.9% alike. But over the course of history, we as \nhumans have spent a lot of time dividing ourselves up into \ndifferent groups, categories, and “kinds” of people, and this has \nsometimes had harmful consequences. So what do we do with \nour 0.1% of genetic difference? Is that meaningful or not? Why \nor why not? Those questions really captivate me.\nUnderstand: How can genetic data be used?\nPeople’s genetic data contains a lot of information that can be useful. Different \ngroups often collect genetic data. Sometimes it is collected for research, for example \nto understand more about human diseases. Sometimes it is collected by companies \nthat analyze genetic data to answer questions about ancestry and possible health \noutcomes. Sometimes genetic data is collected by law enforcement to try to solve \ncrimes. In this activity, you will think more about how genetic data is used and the \nimpacts of those decisions.\n\t 1. Read Genetic Data Use One through Genetic Data Use Five and answer the \nquestions to consider by yourself.\nGenetic Data Use One: Law Enforcement\nDutch investigators caught an art thief using DNA evidence. After an art heist, \ninvestigators found a sample of DNA left behind on a picture frame. The sample \nfrom the frame helped investigators identify several people who had contact with \nthe stolen artwork, including a man who had previously been to jail for art theft. \nAuthorities concluded that since this man’s DNA was present at the scene of the \ncrime, he must have been the person who stole the paintings. The accused thief \nsays he is innocent. He says the paintings could have been stolen by any of the \npeople whose DNA was left behind at the scene.\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 176    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nQuestions to consider\n\t a. If you were an investigator, how certain would you feel that you had caught \nthe right person?\nb. Are there instances you can think of when DNA evidence does not lead to a \njust outcome?\n\t\nGenetic Data Use Two: Research\nGovernments, private companies, and research institutions are creating \ndatabases of genetic data they have gathered from many people. Researching \nthe data in these databases can help answer questions about genetic diseases \nand potential treatments. Some of these databases are open access, or able \nto be freely accessed by other researchers. However, many databases have \nrestrictions. Data in the databases are deidentified, meaning there are no \nnames attached to genetic data. But some institutions are still concerned about \nprivacy and so they limit access to the database or only share some genetic \ndata. Other times, companies may want to keep ownership over data they have \ncollected.\nKadija says . . . \nOne way that data can be kept private or confidential is by \ntaking off identifying information. For some kinds of data, \nyou can take off someone’s name, address, or gender and \nstill be able to use that information as anonymous data for \na particular function. But with genomic information, that \ndata is quite literally about you. How do you make genetic \ndata anonymous and still use it in beneficial ways, such as \nfor health research?\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 177    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nQuestions to consider\n\t a. What concerns do you have about data being open access? What advantages \ndo you think there are?\nb. Do you think a company should be able to own someone else’s genetic data? \nIf not, who should own it?\nc. Review what Kadija says. Do you think it is possible to deidentify genetic data?\n\t\n\t\nGenetic Data Use Three: Personalized Marketing\nYou can pay a company to gather the genetic data from your DNA, a process \ncalled direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing. Your results can show information \nabout your ancestry, or what part of the world your ancestors came from. It \ncan also show potential diseases you might be at risk for. Recently, through \na partnership with a music streaming service, a direct-to-consumer testing \ncompany even created personalized music playlists based on your ancestry!\nQuestions to consider\n\t a. Do you have any concerns about your genetic data being used to market things \nthat might be interesting to you, based on your ancestry, like music or recipes?\nb. What if the marketed items were based on your health information in your \nDNA? Is that different?\n\t\nGenetic Data Use Four: Healthcare Decisions\nResults from DTC companies can show if you are more likely to develop certain \ndiseases. However, these results arrive to you virtually. There are no experienced \nhealth care professionals to help you interpret them. People may make decisions \nabout their own behaviors, such as choosing to have children or keeping up with \npreventive health screenings, based on these results. They also may choose to \nshare these results with relatives who may have similar results. DTC results are not \nalways completely accurate or easily interpreted.\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 178    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nQuestions to consider\n\t a. Do you think there should be a requirement to have a health care professional \ntalk to people who have a high risk of developing a disease, based on their \nDTC results?\nb. What potential problems are there if people share results with their relatives \nwhen their relatives do not want to know the information?\n\t\nGenetic Data Use Five: Data for Sale\nDTC companies are paid by consumers to test their genetic data and share those \nresults. However, pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, health and \nbeauty companies, and technology startups all sometimes pay DTC genetic \ntesting companies for access to a database of their users’ deidentified genetic \ndata. Figure 5-4 shows an example. \nFigure 5-4: The DTC business model: Individuals share a genetic sample with DTC companies. \nThese companies return the genetic data to the individual, but also sell it to pharmaceutical \ncompanies, research institutions, and other companies.\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 179    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nQuestions to consider\n\t a. Do you have any concerns about the way DTC companies sell genetic data?\nb. What are the benefits to individuals of the DTC business model? What are the \nbenefits to DTC companies?\n\t\n\t 2. Gather together with your team. Discuss the different examples and your answers \nto the questions.\na. Did anyone in your team have different answers?\nb. How do you think others in your community might answer?\n3. Read what Kadija says. What do you think is important to think about when \ndiscussing how genetic data is gathered or used?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nKadija says . . . \nGenetic data in some ways is the most personal kind of \ninformation that there can be about a person. It’s literally the \nsequence of the genetic material in your cells. We inherit our \ngenetic data from our family members, so this information is \npersonal to you, but some of it is also shared among your family \nmembers. \nIf we have access to this very personal data about an individual, how should \nwe analyze that data? We can find out interesting things, such as what makes \npeople sick. Genetic data is a very powerful resource, on one hand. However, \nwe also have to think about how to use this very personal information in a way \nthat’s safe and just, and fair to individuals and to communities.\n4. Now you will discuss these ideas with more people in your community. Read \nGenetic Data Interview Instructions and carry out your investigation.\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 180    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nGenetic Data Interview Instructions\nYou can interview people in your community to learn about their experience \nwith or feelings on gathering and using genetic data. This can help you  \nfind out your community’s opinions on genetic testing and the use of  \ngenetic data. \nChoosing people to interview\n\t a. Think about who might know the most about the use of genetic data. For \nexample, it might be a teacher at your school, a person who has used a DTC \ntest, a local scientist, people who work in health care, or leaders who make \ndecisions for your community. \nb. Every person in your community has a valuable perspective. Think back to \nyour Identity Map from Part 1. Different parts of your identity help give you \ninformation. If you can, interview people from a variety of ages, genders, \nsexualities, jobs, incomes, religions, ethnicities, or other identities so you can \nget a variety of information. As a team, try to talk to people who live in all \nparts of your community.\nc. Think about the many ways people can share information and try not to leave \ngroups of people out. For example, some people in your community may not \nuse your language. Try to find someone to help you translate so you can find \nout more about their experiences. \nd. Conducting interviews can take a long time, so you may decide to  \ninterview just one person. That is okay. If everyone on your team interviews \nat least one person, you will have enough information to complete the \nactivity. \n\t\n\t\n\t\nQuestions\nWith your team, develop a list of questions to ask during the interview. Think \nabout the questions you answered as part of Genetic Data Use One through \nGenetic Data Use Five. Are any of those questions ones you want to ask during an \ninterview? \nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 181    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nAre there other questions you would like to ask your community? Be sure to \ninclude questions to help you find out about experiences or concerns you don’t \nalready know about. For example:\n\t a. Do you have any experience with genetic data or testing?\nb. Do you feel like genetic testing is safe? Is it safer to test yourself at home or at \na clinic or research facility? \nc. Are there any ways you or others in our community could benefit from \ngenetic data?\nd. What are the concerns about your privacy when receiving genetic testing? \n\t\n\t\n\t\nWays to record an interview\n\t a. You can interview people many ways, such as in person, over the phone, using \nemail, or through a social media platform.\nb. You can use audio or video to record an interview. \nc. You can write or draw to make a record of the ideas that are shared with you. \n\t\n\t\nTips for conducting an interview\n\t a. Make sure to ask permission to record a person’s answers. \nb. Ask permission to share the interview with the rest of your team, class, or \nother people in the community. People might be more willing to share if their \ninterview is anonymous. \nc. If it feels as if someone didn’t answer your question, don’t be afraid to ask the \nquestion again in a different way. \nd. Let the person you are interviewing answer the questions in the way they \nwant. Be patient. Listen carefully. Understand that they might give answers \nyou didn’t ask for or expect. \n\t\n\t\n\t\nSafety tips for interviewing people\nAsk your teacher for guidelines. They will know what is safest in your community. \nPart 5 Task 1\n Physical Safety Tip\nNever conduct an interview alone and always be aware of your \nsurroundings. You might want to suggest recording the interview in a \nquiet public place. \n Emotional Safety Tip\nIt can be hard to communicate with other people in the community. You \nmay feel shy or nervous. Someone may tell you they don’t want to talk. \nThat’s okay! It doesn’t have anything to do with you. It just means they \ndon’t want to share. You can show them respect by thanking them and \nmoving on to another community member.\n5. Examine the results of your interviews with the rest of your team.\na. What common responses do you notice?\nb. Did anyone say anything that surprised you?\nc. How do you think the information you collected might be useful when making \ndecisions about genetic data?\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 182    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nAct: What rights do people, scientists, and companies have to genetic data?\nBiotechnology is changing rapidly. Researchers are now able to gather and sequence \nmany more DNA samples much more quickly. When science moves quickly, \nsometimes people do not have an opportunity to think about different perspectives \non the way it may be used. In this activity you will explore different perspectives \nabout genetic data ownership and use, and consider which you would like to share \nwith others.\n\t 1.  With a partner, start by discussing what it means to own something. Then discuss \nwhat it means to own genetic data. \n2.  Now read Kadija’s thoughts. Did her ideas make you think differently about \nanything?\n\t\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 183    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nKadija says . . . \nYou might be interested in science and want to give a research \nstudy access to your genomic information for the common \ngood. But because blood relatives have some similar genetic \ninformation, you would also be giving that research project \naccess to your family’s shared genetic information. Some of \nyour family members might not want their information used as \na part of this research! But because you want to, some of their \ninformation would be included in a research study.\n\t 3. Think back to the question of ownership from Genetic Data Use Two. With your \npartner, decide which people or groups might think they have some ownership \nover genetic data.\n4. With your partner, think about the following potential owners of DNA and answer \nthe questions together:\na. Individual person:\n• Genetic data is information stored in an individual person’s DNA. Does an \nindividual automatically own their own data? \n• Do you own data gathered from samples you left around, such as samples \nfrom found hair or saliva?\nb. Relatives:\n• Your genetic information is very similar to that of your family and can be \nused to gain a lot of information about people related to you. Does that \nmake genetic data collectively owned? \n• Should you be consulted before your relatives test their own DNA? \n• Should you have to ask your relatives before you test your own DNA?\nc. Private companies and public research institutions:\n• Private research institutions can patent genes they create in a laboratory. \nA patent is a license from the government that means an individual or \ncompany owns an invention for a period of time. This helps make sure they \ncan profit from their research. Can a company own genetic data?\n• Should genes be patented like other things? \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPart 5 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 184    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 5. Divide your team into three groups. These groups will consider three out of \nthe four perspectives you learned about in Part 1. For right now, do not worry \nabout the environmental perspective. Instead, assign each team to one of these \nperspectives:\na. Social is about the interaction of people in a community. The health, \neducation, and well-being of people are the most important thing from this \nperspective.\nb. Economic is about money, income, and the use of wealth. Economic growth, \nincluding making sure people have jobs and enough money, is the most \nimportant thing from this perspective.\nc. Ethical means the fairness of something. Doing what is right and having a just \ncommunity where everyone is treated fairly is the most important thing from \nthis perspective.\n6. Have each group use a large piece of paper or the board to list their ideas from \neach perspective. Write or draw answers to these questions:\na.

If you used a piece of paper, tape it on a wall or somewhere people can examine it.\n9. Move around and examine each group’s work. If you think something listed is \nimportant to remember or you would want to share it with others, find a way to \nmark it either by drawing a star, circling it, checking it, or another method.\n 10. Come back together as a team and examine all the information your team thought \nwas important from the three perspectives. What are the new perspectives that \nindividuals, companies, researchers, or other groups should consider?\n 11. By yourself, pick one important perspective you would like to share or remember. \nDecide who you want to share this perspective with and create a way to do that. \nFor example:\na. If you want to remember information yourself, you might write a short \nreflection or draw a picture to help you remember the important perspective \non genetic information.\nb. If you want to share with a family member, you might write them a letter \nexplaining the perspective you want to share.\nc. If you want to share with a company or group of researchers, you might \ncompose a social media post tagging them. If you feel comfortable, you can \npost it.\n 12.

Environmental DNA, or eDNA, is a sample of all \nthe DNA of the many living things that are present in an environment. In this task, you \nwill discover how eDNA can help you answer questions about the living things around \nyou. Then you will use case studies to understand how eDNA analysis can be used to \nresearch questions from public health to conservation to archaeology. Finally, you will \nact on this information by creating an experiment with eDNA that considers different \nperspectives.\nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Irene Xagoraraki. Irene (pronounced i-REEN) is one of \nthe many researchers around the world using biotechnology. \nIrene will be your research mentor to help you understand more \nabout how biotechnology can help us learn more about the \npeople and other living things around us.\nIrene is a professor of environmental engineering at Michigan State University in the \nUnited States. She has a PhD in environmental engineering. However, she also has \nknowledge and perspectives that came from other parts of her identity. Since Irene is \nnow working with you, it is important to understand who she is. \nTo help you, Irene filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Irene’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• 52 years old (born in 1970)\n• Bachelor’s degree from the University of the Aegean in Greece, and PhD from \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n• Greek by birth, US-Greek dual citizen\n• Female\n• Lives in Michigan, United States\n• Crete, Greece, is an important place to her and her family\n• Interested in education, science, nature, geopolitics\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 187    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n• Likes spending time by the water, walking in nature, hiking, gardening, \nphotography, puzzles, live music, dancing, movies\n• Brown eyes, brown hair, Mediterranean look\n• Kind, down-to-earth, conscientious, funny\n• Mother, wife\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Irene’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Irene? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Irene? \n• Can you see anything about Irene’s identity, in addition to her university \ndegrees, that would help her understand different perspectives or ideas about \nusing genetic data? \nThroughout this task you will notice Irene sharing ideas and experiences with you. \nShe may help you understand better ways to do your research or share some of \nthe research she has done.\nDiscover: How can we use biotechnology to learn more about our environment?\nEarth and its system of many living things is complex. Sometimes we want to \nmake good decisions to help people and the planet, but we do not have enough \ninformation. For example, maybe we don’t know which or how many living things are \nin a place. Sometimes eDNA can help solve this problem.\n\t 1. Read Living Things Search Instructions and follow the steps.\nLiving Things Search Instructions\nSometimes you can directly observe a living thing, for example if you see a plant or a \nbug. Sometimes you can use other evidence to know whether a living thing has been \nin a place. For example, a person might leave personal items behind like a jacket or \nbag. Another living thing might leave paw prints or scat (poop). In this investigation, \nyou will be listing all the living things you can directly observe or find evidence of.\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 188    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPick a research area\nPick a place to do your research. It does not need to be very large. If you can use \nan outdoor location, that might be best. However, even in an indoor location there \nare usually many different types of living things. Find a partner and make sure you \npick a place where both partners can move around easily.\nIdentify evidence\nThink about what you might use as evidence—for example, things a living thing \nleft behind, like a specific smell, food, scat, leaves, claw marks, pieces of hair or fur, \nprints, trails, holes, homes, or nests. \nPrepare to observe\nTake out a piece of paper to make a list of all the living things you observe or find \nevidence of. Draw two columns on your list. Label one “Living Thing” and the other \n“Evidence.” Figure 5-5 shows an example. \nLiving Thing\nEvidence\nFigure 5-5: Sample Observation List of living things and evidence of them.\nYou can use any of your senses to make observations on your Observation List. \n\t a. If you observe a living thing, write it down in the Living Thing column and \nthen write how you observed it under Evidence.\nb. If you know which living thing was in a place because of evidence you find, \nwrite it down in the Living Thing column and the evidence in the Evidence \ncolumn.\nc. If you can find evidence of a living thing but you don’t know which living \nthing it is evidence of, just write down the evidence in the Evidence column.\n\t\n\t\nMake your observations\nWrite or draw the things you observe on your Observation List.\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 189    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nAnalyze your results\nWith your partner, consider:\n\t a. Are there any living things you feel sure have been in your research area \nthat you did not observe or find evidence of? For example, maybe you have \nnoticed spiders in your research area before but did not find any today.\nb. What would you need to do to make sure you found evidence of all the living \nthings in your research area?\n\t\n\t 2. With your team, discuss:\na. Can you think of any way biotechnology might help researchers know which \nliving things have been in a place?\nb. Why do you think that might be helpful?\n3. Read Finding eDNA.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFinding eDNA\nScientists can use eDNA analysis to collect a sample from a place and find out \nwhich living things are present. Especially when living things are hard to find or \nare microscopic, this can give them a lot more information. They can even discover \nliving things they did not know were there! \neDNA can be used to gather information about many different types of \nenvironments. Samples of air, water, soil, sand, ice, and snow can all be used for \neDNA analysis. For example, air may have small pollen particles that contain \nDNA and pond water may have small pieces of DNA from all the things living in \nthe pond. Using eDNA gives scientists a quick, affordable way to learn about an \nenvironment.\nTo study eDNA, scientists often go through several steps:\n\t a. Collect a sample from the environment.\nb. Extract the DNA by separating it from everything else in the sample.\nc. Amplify, or make many copies, of the extracted DNA.\n\t\n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 190    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t\n\t d. Sequence the DNA.\ne. Compare the sequenced DNA to databases of living things to see which ones \nare in the sample.\n\t\nRemember in Task 1 when you learned about how scientists are collecting \nreference genomes. Examine the eDNA steps. Why would a database of many \ndifferent reference genomes be important to help you identify which types of \nliving things are present?\n4. Match each of the investigations in Figure 5-6 with one or more sample locations \nwhere you could take eDNA samples. Share your answers with your team. Do \nothers on your team agree on the best location for the sample?\nInvestigation\nSample Location\n1. \t\u0007Use eDNA to detect invasive carp, a kind of fish, instead of \nusing nets.\n2. \t\u0007Use eDNA to find out which species of birds are living in an \narea instead of tagging them.\n3. \t\u0007Use eDNA to understand biodiversity in deep areas of the ocean.\n4. \t\u0007Use eDNA to find out whether ancient humans lived in a \nspecific place.\n5. \t\u0007Use eDNA to determine the diversity of land animals instead of \nusing cameras.\n6. \t\u0007Use eDNA to evaluate the health of endangered sea turtles \ninstead of drawing their blood.\n7. \t\u0007Use eDNA taken from core samples of a 20,000-year-old glacier \nto find out how the surrounding plants have changed.\n8. \t\u0007Use eDNA to identify lynx tracks in the snow more easily, \ninstead of using expert identification.\na.\t Sand\nb.\t Air\nc.

With your partner, think about the living things that were missing from your list \nduring the living things search. \na. Where in your research area would you need to sample eDNA to find evidence \nof these living things?\nb. What types of things could you find out about your research area if you took \neDNA samples? Read what Irene says to help give you ideas.\n\t\n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!  \n Part 5 – Page 191  \n© 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nIrene says . . . \nThere is a wealth of information in eDNA. You can learn so much \nstuff; you can be a detective. I think it is very exciting, lots of fun!\nUnderstand: What types of problems can we use environmental genetic data \nto identify?\nYou know that analyzing eDNA can give you more information about the living things \nin a specific place. But how do researchers use this information? In this task you will \nexplore four different ways eDNA is being used in research. Then you will design a \nresearch experiment of your own for your local community.\t\n1. Take out a piece of paper and title it “eDNA Experimental Design Organizer.” Draw\nsix rows and five columns. Label the rows and columns as shown in Figure 5-7. You\nwill be using this paper to help you remember what you learn during this activity.\nIf you do not have time to do all four case studies, just pick one or two to help\nyou learn more about eDNA before you design your own eDNA experiment.

Read Invasive Species Case Study and use the information you learn to fill in your \neDNA Experimental Design Organizer. \nInvasive Species Case Study1\nImagine you are plant biologist studying invasive species. You are worried that a \nplant called the tree of heaven is starting to invade a new area. The tree of heaven \nis an invasive plant from Asia that grows rapidly and crowds out native species \nin the United States. It even poisons the ground around it so other plant species \ncannot grow. The earlier you find the invasive tree of heaven, the better chance \nyou have to remove the plants before they become widespread.\nYou want to monitor your research area to make sure there are no tree of heaven \nplants. Right now, your team members go out and do a visual survey, which \nmeans they move around an area looking for different types of trees. Recently, \nyou learned eDNA can be used to analyze air samples. You wonder if this method \nmight detect the pollen from invasive trees and if it would be a better method \nthan a visual survey.\nYour team completes a visual survey. They also collect air eDNA samples to \nanalyze. Figure 5-8 shows their results.\nVisual Survey Species\nAir eDNA Analysis Species\nBlack willow\nBlack willow\nHoney mesquite\nHoney mesquite\nSiberian elm\nTree of heaven\nFigure 5-8: Tree species found using a visual survey and using air eDNA analysis.\nAnalyzing results\nAs a scientist, you can use your results to answer the following questions. Write \nor draw what you think is important in your eDNA Experimental Design Organizer, \nthen discuss with your team:\n\t a. How were the results different using a visual survey method and an air eDNA \nanalysis method?\nb. Did you detect the invasive species you are studying?\n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 193    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t c. Which method helped you detect that species?\nd. This study was done only with trees, but do you think eDNA analysis would \nwork better than visual surveys for detecting all types of plants? Which plants \nmight it not work as well for?\ne. What would you conclude? Is the tree of heaven present in your research \narea?\n\t\n\t\nMaking decisions\nScientists and other decision-makers use information they have gathered to help \nmake better decisions. Use what you learned to decide which actions to take next, \nwrite or draw your ideas in your organizer, and then discuss with your team. Pick \none option. Do you think the community should:\n\t a. Launch an effort to remove the invasive tree of heaven before it spreads and \nhurts the local ecosystem.\nb. Take no action, since the visual survey did not find the tree of heaven.\n\t\nScientists also need to decide what kind of research they will do next. Pick one \noption and discuss your reasoning with your team. Do you think you should:\n\t a. Monitor your research area for all types of invasive plants using visual \nsurveys.\nb. Monitor your research area for all types of invasive plants using eDNA \nanalysis.\nc. Monitor your research area for all types of invasive plants using visual surveys \nand eDNA analysis.\n\t\n\t\n\t 3. Think about the way air eDNA was used in the Invasive Species Case Study. Can \nyou think of any other way to use eDNA to consider which species are in your \ncommunity? If so, write or draw your ideas in the Your Study row of your eDNA \nExperimental Design Organizer.\n4. Read Irene’s description of another source of eDNA.\n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 194    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nIrene says . . . \nWhat is wastewater? Wastewater is a mixed water that contains \nhuman excrement—anything from the toilet—but also much \nmore. Anything from the shower, the laundry, the dishwasher, \nthe sink, in most cities even storm water and industrial water all \nend up in your wastewater. \nWastewater contains microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses that come \nfrom humans who have been infected by them. These microorganisms are \ndiluted in a huge amount of water where there is also dish soap, storm water, \nmany chemicals, and many impurities. If you are looking for human viruses in \nwastewater you have to look for a needle in a haystack. You have to concentrate \nand isolate the viruses, which means starting with a large volume of water with \nsome human viruses in it, and ending up with a smaller volume of water with the \nsame number of viruses in it. You can then take a subsample of your concentrated \nsample and do eDNA extraction, and after some molecular analysis you can get \ngenetic codes for the viruses that were found in your sample. Those genetic codes \ngive you indications of the viral infections that are present in the population that \nproduced the wastewater.\nFigure 5-9: A researcher working in a wastewater facility.\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 195    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 5. Read Public Health Case Study and use the information you learn to fill in your \neDNA Experimental Design Organizer. \nPublic Health Case Study2\nImagine you are a public health researcher during the COVID-19 pandemic. You \nwant to know when COVID-19 is spreading widely in your community to help you \nmake decisions. The earlier you can predict that COVID-19 cases are going up, the \nsooner you can try to help.\nYou have heard about a method called wastewater surveillance. Wastewater \nsurveillance uses eDNA analysis to find out what is in the wastewater that comes \nfrom toilets, showers, sinks, dishwashers, and washing machines. Wastewater \ncan include DNA from the people living in a place, as well as DNA from viruses, \nbacteria, and other living things.\nYour team decides to use wastewater surveillance for a year, starting in September \n2020. You analyze the number of genomic copies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, \nwhich causes COVID-19. Genomic copies are copies of a specific type of gene in a \nsample. How many there are shows how common something is in a population. \nFor example, the number of genomic copies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should show \nhow widespread that virus is in a population. \nThe results gathered through wastewater surveillance are shown in Figure 5-10. \nThe solid blue area shows the weekly average number of COVID-19 cases reported \nacross several communities in southeastern Michigan. The orange line shows the \nnumber of genomic copies of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 196    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nFigure 5-10: Total cases of COVID-19 in southeastern Michigan and number of genomic copies of the virus found in community \nwastewater, September 2020-August 2021.\nAnalyzing results\nUse your results to answer the following questions. Write or draw what you think is \nimportant in your eDNA Experimental Design Organizer, then discuss with your team:\n\t a. When were the highest peaks of the genomic copies of SARS-Cov-2? \nb. When were the highest peaks of COVID-19 cases?\nc. What patterns do you notice about the peaks of the genomic copies and the \npeaks of the cases?\nd. About how long was there between a peak of the genomic copies and a peak \nof cases?\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 197    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nMaking decisions\nScientists and other decision-makers use information they have gathered to \nhelp make better decisions. Imagine it is the end of August 2021 and you need \nto decide what to do next. There are many tools you can use to prepare for \nwidespread disease, like increased community testing, masking, and planning for \nmore medical workers. However, the community only wants to take protective \nactions when it is most important. Decide which action you think you should take \nnext and record your ideas in your organizer. Then discuss with your team. Pick \none option. Do you think the community should:\n\t a. Prepare for the number of COVID-19 cases to drop. \nb. Prepare for the number of COVID-19 cases to rise.\n\t\n\t 6. Read what Irene says. What are some advantages to using wastewater for analysis?\nIrene says . . . \nIf you want to monitor an upcoming disease, how possible is \nit to collect clinical samples from everyone in the community \nand test for all potential pathogens? You are faced with two \nimpossible tasks: collect clinical samples from everyone in the \ncommunity, and test for all possible pathogenic microorganisms \nthey may be infected with. \nSo I thought, “What’s the easiest way to collect a community composite sample?” \nOne way is to collect wastewater. You can run complex tests on a composite \nsample that would be expensive and difficult to run for every person.\n\t 7. Think about the way eDNA was used in the Public Health Case Study. Can you think \nof any way to use eDNA for public health in your community? If so, write or draw \nyour ideas in the Your Study row of your eDNA Experimental Design Organizer.\n8. Read Conservation Case Study and use the information you learn to fill in your \neDNA Experimental Design Organizer. \n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 198    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nConservation Case Study3\nImagine you are a conservation biologist studying a local population of rare and \nendangered tortoises. You are wondering if the many local foxes (which are not \nendangered) might be eating tortoises and causing the tortoise population to \ndecline.\nYour team decides that studying fox scat (poop) would be the best way to figure \nout if the foxes are eating the tortoises.\nYou first decide to collect fox scat and visually examine the tortoise remains \n(bones, scales, and shells) in the samples. Out of the 212 fox scat samples \nyou collected, you find remains from other small animals, but you find zero \nrecognizable tortoise parts.\nZero seems like a really low number, so you decide to test your results by using \neDNA analysis on the scat samples. This time, you find evidence of tortoise DNA in \n27 of the 212 fox scat samples.\nAnalyzing results\nUse your results to answer the following questions. Write or draw what you think \nis important in your eDNA Experimental Design Organizer, then discuss with your \nteam:\n\t a. Why do you think you found evidence of tortoise parts in the fox scat only \nthrough eDNA analysis? \nb. Why might this information be important?\n\t\nMaking decisions\nScientists and other decision-makers use information they have gathered to help \nmake better decisions. Use what you learned to decide which actions to take next \nand record your ideas in your organizer. Then discuss with your team. Pick one \noption. Do you think conservationists should:\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 199    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t a. Try to discourage the foxes from eating the tortoises. For example, you could \nmake foxes think that tortoises taste bad by putting out foul-tasting fake \ntortoises.\nb. Do not take action to stop foxes from eating tortoises, since it seems like it is \nnot a big problem.\n\t\n\t 9. Think about the way eDNA was used in the conservation case study. Can you think \nof any way to use eDNA for conservation in your community? If so, write or draw \nyour ideas in the Your Study row of your eDNA Experimental Design Organizer.\n 10. Read Ancient DNA Case Study and use the information you learn to fill in your eDNA \nExperimental Design Organizer. \nAncient DNA Case Study4\nImagine you are an archaeologist studying the ancestors of modern humans, early \nhominins. You are interested in knowing where different types of hominins lived \nhundreds of thousands of years ago. You are exploring where ancient hominins \nknown as Denisovans lived, compared to where ancient hominins known as \nNeandertals lived.\nYou collect eDNA in layers from a cave in Russia. Layers with higher numbers in \nthe chart are buried deeper. The layers show the following results:\nLayer 11.2 (shallowest layer)\nDenisovan DNA (fossil)\nLayer 11.4\nNeandertal DNA (fossil and sediment)\nLayer 12.1\nDenisovan DNA (fossil)\nLayer 12.3\nNeandertal DNA (fossil)\nLayer 14\nNeandertal DNA (sediment)\nLayer 15 (deepest layer)\nDenisovan DNA (sediment)\nFigure 5-11:  Hominin eDNA found in cave layers.\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 200    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nAnalyzing results\nUse your results to answer the following questions. Write or draw what you think is \nimportant in your eDNA Experimental Design Organizer, then discuss with your team:\n\t a. Was there evidence of hominins in the cave?\nb. Why was eDNA analysis helpful in finding out who was in the cave and when?\n\t\nMaking decisions\nScientists and other decision-makers use information they have gathered to help \nmake better decisions. Use what you learned to decide which actions to take next \nand record that in your organizer. Then discuss your ideas with your team. Pick \none option. As an archaeologist should you:\n\t a. Only test for eDNA in places where evidence of hominins has already been \nfound.\nb. Test for eDNA even in places that seem likely to have evidence of hominins, \neven if no fossils have been found so far.\n\t\n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 201    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nAct: Should we use biotechnology to help identify problems in the \nenvironment?\nJust because eDNA can be used to find out information does not always mean \nit should be used. In this task you will consider more about ethical and other \nperspectives. You will also consider the importance of involving the local community \nwhen you make decisions about research that could affect them. Then you will use \nthese ideas to modify your eDNA experiment.\n\t 1. Take out your Ethical Concerns List from Part 1 and remind yourself what those \nconcerns were. \n2. Now think about the Public Health Case Study from the Understand activity. Discuss \nwith your team: Do you notice any potential ethical concerns about gathering \neDNA for public health reasons? Be sure to think about:\na. Privacy: When collecting wastewater samples, it could be possible to obtain \nsamples from the place where a household connects to the sewer system. If \nthat sample is analyzed, it would reveal information about the people living in \nthat household, including their genetic data and any diseases that are present. \nIs this a concern?\nb. Justice: You could examine the overall prevalence or risk of certain diseases \nin certain communities. While this can be useful to help design ways to \nhelp the community, what if health or life insurance companies used that \ninformation to charge people living in the community higher rates? Is this a \nconcern?\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 202    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 3. With your team, discuss rules or approaches that could help address any ethical \nconcerns. Read what Irene says to learn how her research group approaches the \nissue of privacy. Do you think this is a good approach?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nIrene says . . . \nThe issue of privacy is very important. To make sure we address \nit, we collect samples from places that include the wastewater \nfrom thousands of people. We’re zooming out and looking at \nthe bigger scale. We don’t focus on the specific households that \nthe wastewater comes from. We focus on a population of a city \nor of a county at large. That way no one who looks at our results \ncan pinpoint a specific household or a person.\n4. Think back to the other case studies. Are there other ethical concerns you can \nthink of?\n5. Examine the three perspectives sheets you worked on in groups during Task 1. \nDo you have anything you would like to add to the social, economic, or ethical \nperspectives on the way genetic data can or should be used?\n6. Now, with your team, create a sheet for the fourth perspective: environmental. \nWrite or draw answers to these questions:\na. What are the important uses of genetic data from this perspective?\nb. Are there any concerns about the use of genetic data from this perspective?\nc. Who should own or be considered when thinking about genetic data from this \nperspective?\n7. Look at the eDNA experiment you designed from the Understand activity. Examine \nit carefully. Are there any potential concerns you notice from any of the four \nperspectives? If so, create a way to address those concerns.\nPart 5 Task 2\nBiotechnology!     Part 5 – Page 203    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 8. Now pick three other people on your team and explain your experiment plans \nto them. Then switch roles. When researchers design a community investigation, \nthey need to make sure they pay attention to the opinions and feelings of people \nliving in the community. Surveys, meeting with community leaders, and holding a \nmeeting with the public can all help with this process. By explaining your ideas to \nyour team, you are learning about the perspectives of others in your community in \na limited way.\n9. When a teammate is explaining their experiment to you, think carefully.  \nWould you have any additional concerns? If so, share those ideas with your \nteammate.\n 10. After receiving feedback from your team community, examine your experiment \nagain. Is there anything you would like to change? What can you do to address any \nconcerns?\n 11. If you feel comfortable, present your research idea to your community! You could \nuse a poster, give a talk, or use another creative way to share your experiment with \nyour classroom, school, or in another local space. Discuss:\na. What question did you chose to answer using eDNA?\nb. How did you design your experiment?\nHow have you considered the four perspectives, including the \nethical perspective, and did you make any changes because of these \nperspectives?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nCongratulations!\nYou have finished Part 5.\nFind out More!\nFor additional resources and activities, please visit the Biotechnology!

Then you will create a model to understand how \nbiotechnology can be used to help reduce or eliminate waste and pollution. Finally, \nyou will act to choose and suggest some of these solutions to your community. \nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Susie Dai. Susie (pronounced SOO-zee) is one of the \nmany researchers around the world trying to use biotechnology \nto help the environment. Her team tries to find ways to use \nliving things, such as fungi and bacteria, to break down harmful \nchemicals in the environment. \nSusie is a scientist and researcher at Texas A&M University in the United States. She \nhas a PhD in chemistry. However, she also has knowledge and perspectives that \ncame from other parts of her identity. Since Susie is now working with you, it is \nimportant to understand who she is. \nTo help you, Susie filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Susie’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• 41 years old \n• Asian woman\n• Lives in Texas\n• Is a working mom\n• Was born in China and still has relatives there, but family lives in the US \n• Likes science, engineering, and poetry; enjoys reading and writing\n• Is short with black hair, and wears glasses or contacts\n• “I felt very bad about being short when I was young. I gained more confidence \nafter walking into the professional world. What you look like does not speak for \nwho you are, but what you do is what characterizes you.”\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 212    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\n• Is a funny person, and loves humor! “I think of being hardworking as the salt, \nwhich makes life tasty; love is sugar, which makes life sweet; humor is the light \nbeam, which makes life pleasant.”\n• Is the planner for her family. “I also volunteer in community events that I believe \nmy expertise can contribute to; otherwise, I follow community leaders. There \nshould not be too many cooks in a kitchen.”\n• Advice for young people: “Never forget what interests you when you are in school. \nThe questions you ask at this age are important questions. You should seek those \nanswers over your lifetime. I encourage everyone to always ask questions!”\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Susie’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Susie? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Susie? \n• Can you see anything about Susie’s identity, in addition to her university \ndegrees, that would help her understand different perspectives or ideas about \nthe environment? \nThroughout this task you will notice Susie sharing ideas and experiences with you. \nShe may help you understand better ways to do your research or share some of \nthe research she has done.\nDiscover: How do waste and pollution affect my community?  \nMost communities have some kind of waste or pollution. Waste and pollution can \ntake the form of plastic trash, used cooking or mechanical oils, leftover or unused food, \nsmoke or smog, harmful chemicals, or other materials. Waste and pollution can be \nfound in the air, on land, and in water. In this activity, you and your team will observe \nthe waste and pollution already in your community. \n\t 1. Take out a piece of paper. By yourself, think about the following questions and \ndraw or write your answers.\na. Where have you already noticed waste or pollution in your community? \nb. Do you think you can make those parts of your community cleaner? Why or \nwhy not? \n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 213    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\n\t 2. Read what Susie has to say. She explains the kinds of waste and pollution she is \nmost concerned about in communities. \nSusie says . . . \nMany governments, including the United States government, \nhave standards to make sure drinking water is safe. You can go \nto the Environmental Protection Agency website and find a very \nlong list of contaminants that are part of those standards. You \nmight say, “Oh, this pesticide is on that list, so I should not find \nthis in the public water I drink.” \nBut there are other chemicals that humans are constantly producing that may not \nbe in the standards yet. We call those emergent contaminants. What I’m focused \non now is those emergent contaminants. One of those contaminants is PFAS, or \npolyfluoroalkyl substances. PFAS are also known as “forever” chemicals because of \nhow long it takes for them to break down.\n\t 3. Now you are going to make some observations about waste and pollution in your \ncommunity. Choose a partner or a small group and pick one of the observations \nlisted in Community Observations to complete in your community. \nCommunity Observations\nMake sure your team divides as evenly as possible into three groups to conduct \nyour observations. Each group will observe either air, water, or land. \nYou can do the observations by moving around your local area yourself, \nor by collecting information using maps, photographs, social media posts, \nconversations with community members, or another method that works well for \nyour team. Choose a kind of investigation that allows all members of the team to \nparticipate. You can also choose the area you want to observe. It could be just a \nsmall area around your school or it could be a bigger area, like your neighborhood \nor your town.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 214    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nRemember that your task is just to observe and notice. It is okay if you can’t \nanswer all the questions in your section. It is okay if you notice something that \nmakes you wonder or want to find out more. It is okay if you notice only one \nproblem in your community. You are just collecting as much information as you \ncan about your community! \nObservation #1: Air\nYou will try to notice any waste or pollution in the air in your community. Use the \nfollowing suggestions to help you make your observations.\n• Are there any places where cars, trucks, or other vehicles wait while their \nengines are on (such as a bus lot or a school pickup/drop off area)?\n• Are there streets with heavy traffic during certain times of day?\n• Is it smoggy or smoky on certain days? \n• Can you tell where the smog and smoke are coming from?\n• Is it ever hard to breathe or exercise in your community?\n• Are there factories, construction sites, or other spaces in your community that \ncause smoke, dust, or other kinds of air pollution? \n• Do you notice any signs of smoke, smog, or pollution on statues, monuments, or \nbuildings in the community?  \n• Is anyone from your community already trying to improve air pollution? What \nare they doing to help? \nFigure 6-1: A city with a lot of air pollution.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 215    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nObservation #2: Land\nYou will try to notice any waste or pollution on land in your community. Use the \nfollowing suggestions to help you make your observations.\n• Are there any places where the soil has been dug up, turned over, or disturbed, \nsuch as construction sites, gardens, or farms? \n• Are there places like restaurants, car repair shops, gas stations, or factories where \nyou notice liquids or solids from those businesses seeping into the ground? \n• Where does food waste go in your community?\n• Are there places with abandoned buildings, or where people dump appliances, \ncars, or electronics?\n• Are there places where trash doesn’t get picked up? Are there places with a lot \nof litter?\n• Have any trees been cut down recently in your community?\n• Are there any areas in your community that smell bad or different?\n• Is anyone from your community already trying to improve waste and pollution \non land? What are they doing to help? \nFigure 6-2: Construction equipment digs up an area of land. \nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 216    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nObservation #3: Water\nYou will try to notice any waste or pollution in water in your community. Use the \nfollowing suggestions to help you make your observations.\n• When it rains, were does water go in your community? \n• Are there spaces that are impermeable, meaning water can’t seep through to \nthe ground (such as pavement)?\n• Does your community have streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, wetlands, or \nreservoirs? \n• Are there any places with standing water after a rainstorm, or places that take a \nlong time to drain? \n• Think about the street where you live or the street where your school is. \n• Do you know which way the water flows when it rains? \n• Does your community have storm drains?\n• Do you know where water in the storm drains ends up?\n• Are there any buildings, businesses, factories, landfills, or construction sites that \nhave materials, chemicals, trash, or food waste that could go into the water in \nyour community during a heavy rainstorm?\n• Is anyone from your community already trying to improve waste and pollution \nin water? What are they doing to help? \n \nFigure 6-3: Water flows into a storm drain.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 217    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\n\t 4. Think to yourself first, and then discuss with a partner: \na. How does what you noticed during your observations make you feel?\nb. Are there any problems you want to solve more than others? \n5. Read what Susie says quote about her research and why she does this work. \na. How did noticing a problem help motivate Susie?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nSusie says . . . \nMany people in the United States have access to safe drinking \nwater. But we cannot forget that some people do not. Those \npeople may rely on raw water, which is water that has not been \ntreated to remove contaminants. For example, 10% of the US \npopulation relies on private wells for their drinking water. \nThat got me into my current research, which has two parts. One \npart is trying to understand to what extent people are exposed to toxic chemicals \nin the environment. The other part is trying to understand how to mitigate and \ntreat those risks. \nIt’s important to understand how we can confine contaminants. I’m not saying \nwe’ll stop producing chemicals. But we as human beings need to be responsible \nand accountable to manage those things that we produce. We have to look at \nwhat we put in the environment, and look into solutions to remediate those \ncontaminants.\nUnderstand: How can biotechnology help solve problems of waste and \npollution in a community?\nIn the Discover activity, you and your class made observations about the waste and \npollution in the air, land, and water in your community. In this activity, you will model \na community that has problems with pollution and waste in its air, land, and water. You \nwill learn how biotechnology can help with these problems through something called \nbioremediation. Bioremediation is using living things to correct, stop, or reverse \ndamage to the environment. \nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 218    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\n\t 1. Choose a partner or a small group. \n2. Take out a piece of paper or open a digital document.\n3. Read Community Problems with Waste and Pollution and choose one problem that \ninterests or feels most important to you and your group.\n\t\n\t\nCommunity Problems with Waste and Pollution\nThis section describes several waste and pollution problems that a community \nmight have. \nAbandoned building: An abandoned building has lead paint on its indoor and \noutdoor walls. The lead paint has peeled off the building and lead has now gotten \ninto the soil near the building. When it rains, some of that lead-filled soil washes \naway.  \nShopping area: A shopping area has paved roads, paved sidewalks, and paved \nparking lots. These surfaces are impermeable, meaning rainwater cannot be \nabsorbed. During storms the rainwater goes into storm drains instead. The \nrainwater contains waste and pollution like motor oil, pet waste, tiny rubber \npieces from car tires, and cigarette butts. \nFigure 6-4: Water from this paved road drains into a grassy area.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 219    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nConstruction site: A construction site is digging a large hole for a new building. \nDigging up the soil releases some of the carbon dioxide that was trapped in \nthe soil. And some of the construction vehicles release carbon dioxide from their \nengines. Carbon dioxide is one of the causes of global climate change. \nAthletic field: The community uses a chemical called an herbicide to prevent \nweeds from growing on the grass athletic fields. The herbicide washes away \nduring heavy rainstorms and enters the local rivers, streams, and storm drains. \nBackyards and parks: People in the community use a chemical pesticide to \nreduce or eliminate biting mosquitoes in their backyards and parks. But those \npesticides may kill many other kinds of insects, including honeybees and ladybugs. \nThey can also accidentally poison birds, cats, dogs, fish, and other animals. \nBus parking lot: A fenced parking lot is used to store all the school buses for the \ncommunity. The buses run their engines when leaving, waiting, and returning, and \nrelease pollution into the air. Motor oil leaks from the buses. When the buses are \nwashed, soap and other kinds of cleaning products end up on the pavement and \nseep into storm drains.\nAsphalt road and roofs: The roads in the community are made with a material \ncalled asphalt. Some home and building roofs also use asphalt shingles on the roof. \nOn hot, sunny days, the asphalt heats up and can release pollution into the air. \nPond: A pond in the community is near the shopping area and the abandoned \nbuilding. Some of the water from these areas runs into the pond when it rains.  \n\t 4. Write down or draw the problem you picked on your piece of paper. You can \nuse the title of the problem, the description, a symbol, an illustration, or another \nmarking to represent the problem you chose. For example, if you chose Shopping \nArea, you might draw a shopping bag and a parked car.\n5. Read each of the Bioremediation Solution Cards in Figure 6-5. You will use one or \nmore of these solutions to try to solve the problem you chose in your model.\n6. If you can, print Figure 6-5 and cut out each solution card. You only need one set of \nBioremediation Solution Cards for each group. You can also just read the solutions \nhere and use the icons to record your ideas. \n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 220    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nBioremediation Solution Cards\nRain Garden \nA rain garden is a group of plants that can quickly absorb and filter \nrunoff from roofs, driveways, and sidewalks. The plants trap water and \nhelp it be absorbed into the soil more quickly. Rain gardens reduce \nthe amount of standing water where mosquitoes can breed. The plants, fungi, and \nbacteria in the garden may also filter out some of the pollutants from the water. \nThis helps to keep pollution out of the storm drains and waterways.\nEvergreen Tree\nThis type of tree can trap air pollution in its needle-like leaves, branches, \nand trunk. Evergreen trees have leaves all year round. Like all other \nplants, an evergreen tree absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. Because \nit is so tall and is alive during every season, it can absorb a large amount of carbon \ndioxide over time.\nSunflower\nThis plant uses its roots to absorb heavy metals, like lead, from the soil. \nLike the evergreen tree, it also absorbs carbon dioxide. But the sunflower \ndies off when the temperature gets too cold.\nWater Hyacinth\nThis kind of plant lives in water. It can remove heavy metals like lead \nfrom water. It can also remove pollutants from water. It grows incredibly \nquickly.\nCover Plants\nThese are plants that are planted in areas with bare soil, like empty \nfarm fields or construction sites. One example is the mustard plant. \nThese kinds of plants keep soil, pollution, and heavy metals from \nbeing washed away by rain. They can absorb harmful materials and remove them \nfrom the soil, as well. They can also take carbon dioxide out of the air and help trap \nit in soil.\nFigure 6-5: Bioremediation solutions for problems with waste and pollution. (continued)\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 221    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nAquatic Bacteria\nCertain kinds of bacteria can remove pollution and waste from water, \nsuch as motor oil or poop from humans or other animals. These bacteria \nbreak pollution and waste down into materials that are not harmful.\nSoil Bacteria\nCertain kinds of bacteria can help remove heavy metals like lead from \nsoil. They use the heavy metals for energy and break them down into \nmaterials that are not harmful. Sometimes this process can take a long \ntime.\nGenetically Modified Bacteria\nScientists can change the genome of certain bacteria to help them \nbreak down heavy metals and pollution faster than bacteria found in \nnature.\nGenetically Modified Plants\nScientists can add genes to a plant that help it make its own protection \nagainst pests. For example, there is a certain kind of bacteria that make \na substance that kills flies. If genes from those bacteria are added to a \nplant, the plant can make the substance and protect itself from flies.  \nBiochemical Pesticide\nA biochemical pesticide is nontoxic and is produced naturally by a \nliving thing. One example is a scent that attracts certain kinds of pest \ninsects to a trap or prevents them from mating. \nMicrobial Pesticide\nMicrobial pesticides use bacteria, fungi, viruses, or other small living \nthings to kill pests or plants. For example, a certain fungus can grow on \na caterpillar that is a pest. The fungus absorbs water and nutrients from \nthe caterpillar until the caterpillar dies. Then the fungus can spread through the air \nto other caterpillars.  \nFigure 6-5: (continued)\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 222    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\n\t 7. Ask each member of your group to choose the bioremediation solution \n(or solutions) they think will solve the problem you chose. They can show their \nchoice by placing the card on top of the problem, or by drawing the icons on your \npaper. \n8. Now, as a group, add, rearrange, or remove the solution cards according to what \nyou think will best help solve the problem in your model. Try to agree as a group \nhow you want to solve the problem. Use these questions to guide you:\na. Do any of these solutions seem easier to use than others?\nb. Do you think people in the community might be worried, curious, or want \nmore information about some of the solutions?\nc. Will the solutions work for a short time or a long time?\n9. By yourself, think about these questions:\na. Was it easy to agree? Why or why not?\nb. Were there any solutions that made you worried, uncomfortable, or that you \nwanted to know more about before using?\nc. Were there any solutions that you were excited about?  \n 10. If you would like, choose another model community problem and repeat steps 7 \nand 8. \n 11. Think about one problem that you noticed in your community during the Discover \nactivity. \n 12. Are there any bioremediation solutions from the Understand activity that would \nhelp you solve that problem? Why or why not? \n 13. Researchers are working on many different types of bioremediation solutions. \nRead what Susie says about her research into how fungi can help remediate \ncontaminants in the environment. \na. Susie is trying to find a bioremediation “superhero.” If you were also searching \nfor a bioremediation superhero, what would you want it to do?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 223    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nSusie says . . . \nIf you go out to the forest and look at a piece of dead wood, \nit has mushrooms growing on it, right? The mushrooms are \nbreaking down the material in the dead wood. One of those \nmaterials is lignin. Lignin is the part of a plant’s cell wall that is \nvery hard to break down. That’s why expensive furniture is made \nout of wood with lots of lignin. The furniture lasts a long time \nbecause of the lignin in the wood. Fungi, like the mushrooms on dead wood, can \nbreak down lignin. \nIn my research, we are trying to use the same systems in a fungus that can break \ndown lignin to break down contaminants like forever chemicals. We are using tools \nthat nature already has in place, but that people haven’t really appreciated yet.\nThere are fungi that we have worked with in the past for bioremediation, but \nI am trying to find a new fungus that can do a better job than the ones we \nalready know.

You learned about how biotechnology can help solve problems in the \nUnderstand activity. Now it is time for you to use what you have learned about your \ncommunity and about biotechnology to plan and share how to solve problems in your \ncommunity. \n\t 1. Think back to the Bioremediation Solution Cards. You are going to rank each \nsolution according to how comfortable and confident you would be using it \nand whether you think you would have the power to use this solution in your \ncommunity.

Consider the solutions you ranked at the bottom of the scale. Think to yourself:\na. Would learning more about those solutions make you feel more comfortable \nand confident? How or where could you find more information?\nb. Who would you need to communicate with in your community to get more \npower to suggest or use those solutions? \n3. Thinking about the social, economic, environmental, and ethical perspectives of \nbiotechnology solutions is an important part of taking action. With your partner or \na small group, read Perspectives on Waste and Pollution Solutions. \n\t\n\t\n\t\nPerspectives on Waste and Pollution and Solutions\nSocial\nGenetically engineered bacteria can help break down the harmful pollution and \nmetals in soil and water more quickly than bacteria found in nature. But the risks \nof releasing genetically modified bacteria into the natural environment are still \nbeing studied. Some people in a community may not feel comfortable introducing \nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 225    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\ngenetically engineered organisms into the environment. They might voice \nconcerns such as, “Can the DNA from these bacteria transfer to other living things?” \nIs it right to use genetically engineered organisms if some people are worried? How \nshould communities make this decision, and who should be involved?\nEconomic\nPlants like sunflowers and evergreen trees can help remove pollution from the \nair and soil. But it costs money to buy, plant, and take care of these plants. It also \ntakes time to get permission to plant them, decide where to plant them, and take \ncare of them once they are planted. Who in a community should be responsible \nfor using their time and money to take care of plants to help with waste and \npollution? \nEnvironmental\nWater hyacinths can help to remove pollution and heavy metals from water. They \nare inexpensive, grow fast, and work quickly to clean water. But when they are \nnot native to an area, they can spread quickly, block other plants from growing, \nharm fish populations, and clog rivers, streams, and ponds. Would you use water \nhyacinth if it was not native to your community? Why or why not?\nFigure 6-7: Invasive water hyacinths cover the entire surface of this river.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 226    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\nEthical\nA community may have many different problems with waste and pollution.

Choose one perspective from Perspectives on Waste and Pollution Solutions to \ndiscuss with your partner or a small group. Try to agree on an answer to the \nquestion at the end of each one. When you are done, find another group that \nchose the same perspective. Compare your answers. \n5. Read what Susie has to say about the perspectives she has to consider when \nresearching bioremediation. Do you think any of those perspectives will be \nimportant to your community? \n\t\nSusie says . . . \nOne of the very important goals of bioremediation is that it \nworks quickly and is affordable. \nIf my boss says, “Deal with this chemical within two weeks,” \nI have to get it done in two weeks! If Congress says, “By 2025 we \nhave to achieve this remediation goal,” and I say it will take me \n100 years to do it, those politicians will kick me out of the room. \nIf I want to produce a biofuel, but it’s $20 a gallon, who is going to buy that at the \npump station? \nUsing a fungus to clean up a contaminant is not fast enough for modern society. \nThat’s why my research is trying to move things faster!\nWe want to help a natural organism, like a fungus, remediate in a reasonable \namount of time. What we hope to do is to combine bioremediation with \nother potential systems and tools that already exist in engineering, chemical \nengineering, or environmental engineering, and can be readily integrated into the \nsystems we already have. \nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 227    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 1\n\t 6.

Human activities often have a negative impact on biodiversity. \nBiodiversity is the variety of the many different living things on Earth. In this task \nyou will discover more about the biodiversity problems caused by people. Then you \nwill investigate to understand more about how biotechnology can provide useful \ntools to help conserve biodiversity. Finally, you will act to increase knowledge and \nunderstanding of biodiversity and biotechnology issues in your community. \nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Mary Hagedorn. Mary (pronounced MARE-ee) is \none of the many researchers around the world trying to use \nbiotechnology to help the environment.\nMary is a research scientist at the Center for Species Survival \nat the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. She has \na PhD in marine science. However, she also has knowledge \nand perspectives that came from other parts of her identity. Since Mary is now \nworking with you, it is important to understand who she is. \nTo help you, Mary filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Mary’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• Female\n• Lives in Hawaii, USA\n• Likes to cook, travel, swim, snorkel, garden, and read\n• Only girl in a family of seven brothers\n• Explorer: “Have been an explorer since I was a small child, as I constantly \nexplored the space in and around my neighborhood”\n• Traveler: “Traveled internationally on my own in high school and lived with a \nfamily in Sicily”\n• During graduate school, traveled and lived throughout Central and South \nAmerica working on science research\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 229    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n• “After I got my doctorate, I traveled and lived in a small village in West Africa, \nwhich transformed me as I learned more about this wonderful community that \ncared for each other as part of the social good.”\n• Caring: “I would like to think that the social good of caring for others could also \nbe extended to caring for and protecting our ecosystems and our planet, so that \nevery child can grow up to see and experience beautiful and wild places on Earth.”\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Mary’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Mary? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Mary? \n• Can you see anything about Mary’s identity, in addition to her university \ndegrees, that would help her understand different perspectives or ideas about \nthe environment? \nThroughout this task you will notice Mary sharing ideas and experiences with you. \nShe may help you understand better ways to do your research or share some of \nthe research she has done.\nDiscover: What are the biodiversity issues caused by people?\nLife on Earth depends on biodiversity. Many different living things are part of the \necosystems on which life depends, including human life. In this activity you will find \nout more about your relationship with biodiversity. You will also explore the threats to \nbiodiversity at different levels. \n\t 1. Take out your Identity Map from Part 1 and examine it closely. Remember that each \nperson is unique.\na. What are some things about your identity that makes you different from \nothers around you? Pick one thing to share.\n2. As a team, use a board, a shared piece of paper, or a shared digital document to \ncreate a Team Identity Map.\na. Draw a circle in the center, just like you did for your identity map.\nb. Label this circle “Our Team.”\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 230    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t c. Have each team member add to the Team Identity Map by drawing or writing \nthe part of their identity they picked to share.\n3. As a team, examine the Team Identity Map. Discuss:\na. What is the advantage of having people with many different identities be part \nof the team?\nb. Are there ideas or types of knowledge you have as a group that you would not \nhave as individuals?\nc. Is this true for people in general? Is it useful to have lots of different skills and \ninterests?\n4. Read what Mary says about why she thinks diversity is so important. Why do you \nthink diversity is important? Share your thoughts with a partner.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMary says . . . \nIn countries that have diversity of thought, diversity of beliefs, \ndiversity of backgrounds, diversity of abilities, we do better \nin facing problems. This is because when you only think in \none way, you will tend to answer a problem in only one way. \nSo having diversity of thought, people, and beliefs helps us \nbecome stronger and have a variety of different approaches. It’s \nthe same thing in plants, in animals, in other living things: When you have more \ndiversity, it just gives you more options to respond to different challenges.\n\t 5. Read What Are Types of Biodiversity?\nWhat Are Types of Biodiversity?\nThe variety you find among people is partially due to small differences in their \ngenomes. This can be thought of as variations in the sequence of genes, which \ncan lead to all sorts of differences in individual humans. \nThe same is true for other species. A species is a type of living thing, like a human \nor a dog or a coconut tree. Variations in the genome of a species are called genetic \ndiversity. High genetic diversity, which is a large variety of different traits in the \nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 231    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\npopulation, gives the population a greater chance to survive threats and stresses \nin the environment. Even if a specific individual within a population doesn’t \nsurvive a threat, a species with high genetic diversity is more likely not to go \nextinct. Figure 6-8 shows some of the genetic diversity of dogs.\nFigure 6-8: Different breeds show the genetic diversity in dogs.\nHowever, diversity isn’t only within a genome. Having lots of different species \npresent in a place is also important. This is called species diversity. Species fill \nmany different roles in an ecosystem. An ecosystem is a community of living \nand non-living things. Some species produce food, like plants. Others eat plants, \nlike humans and deer. Others decompose or break down once-living things, \nlike fungi and bacteria. Many species are involved in each of these roles within \nan ecosystem. Generally, when a greater number of species live in a place, the \necosystem is better able to overcome challenges, like a changing climate or the \nloss of one species in the ecosystem. Figure 6-9 shows an example of a coral reef \necosystem with many different species. How many can you spot?\nFigure 6-9: Example of species biodiversity within a coral reef ecosystem.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 232    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\nA variety of ecosystems is also an important part of biodiversity. There are many \ntypes of ecosystems, from a swamp to a mountain meadow to a coral reef. A \nwide variety of ecosystems is called ecosystem diversity. Ecosystem diversity \nencourages a broader range of species and is important for the planet. For \nexample, think of how many different types of species could live in the ecosystems \nfound in Figure 6-10.\nFigure 6-10: A place with a variety of ecosystems:  \nlake, rocky beaches, pine forest, and snowy mountains.\n\t 6. Discuss with your team:\na. How do you think genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity \nrelate to one another? For example, does genetic diversity lead to species \ndiversity?\nb. Why do you think it is important to have biodiversity on Earth? Make sure you \nthink about how all species, including humans, are connected to one another.\n7. You will be using elkhorn coral populations as an example to investigate how \ngenetic diversity affects the ability of a population to survive. Read Mary’s \nthoughts. What are some of the problems facing the species of elkhorn coral in the \nCaribbean?\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 233    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t\nMary says . . . \nThe ocean in the Caribbean is in a very bad shape. It’s small and \nit only has about 60 species of coral. It has a history of pollution, \ndiseases, and other local stressors. Imagine you have all these \nbeautiful islands, and they all have these amazing corals around \nthem. Over time some of these corals were blown up to make \nbays and things like that. It only got worse as more people went \ninto the Caribbean, in terms of tourism and boats and traffic. You also have global \nstressors, such as climate change, on top of that. Some scientists predict that by \nthe mid-2030s, only 1% of global corals will still exist.\n8. Read Genetic Diversity Card Game Instructions and play the game. \nGenetic Diversity Card Game Instructions\nThe problem \nElkhorn coral is a species of coral that lives in the Caribbean, Florida, and the \nBahamas. Although elkhorn coral are just a single species, they are a very \nimportant part of their ecosystem. Elkhorn coral form dense groups called \nthickets in shallow water. These thickets provide places for fish and other wildlife \nto live. However, human impacts threaten the elkhorn coral population.\nYour goal\nYour goal is to have as many elkhorn coral individuals survive as possible.\nTypes of cards\nThere are two types of cards:\n\t a. Elkhorn Coral Cards (12): Each of these cards represents an individual coral \nthat is part of the elkhorn coral population. Each individual is genetically \nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 234    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\nunique and has different traits and abilities. Four traits are represented in \nthe cards:\n• Myxococcales level: Myxococcales is a bacteria that helps elkhorn coral \nresist white band disease. Some coral encourage the growth of more \nmyxocaccales around them.\n• Heat resistance: The ability to live in warming water\n• Deep sea level: The ability to live in deeper water\n• Oxygen strength level: The ability to survive when there is less oxygen in \nthe water\n\t b. Scenario Cards (4): Each card shows a situation that could happen to the coral \npopulation.\nPlaying the game\n\t 1. Print and cut out the Elkhorn Coral Cards in Figure 6-11 and the Scenario \nCards in Figure 6-12. If you cannot print the cards, you can write the \ninformation from the cards on a piece of paper and cut it apart.\n2. Divide the Elkhorn Coral Cards evenly among your group. There are 12 \ncards, so if possible make your group a size where the cards can be evenly \ndistributed.\n3. Place the Scenario Cards face down between the players.\n4. Have one player pick a Scenario Card and read it to the group. Each scenario \nwill focus on a specific trait.\n5. Each trait on the Elkhorn Coral Cards has a different number value. If the \nnumber is below the allowed number on the Scenario Card, discard the \nElkhorn Coral Card. \n6. After each round, count how many corals are left.\n7. Then draw another Scenario Card and continue.\n8. Keep playing until all four Scenario Cards have been used.\n9. How many corals are left at the end?\nPlay again to see if the number of corals left at the end changes if you pick the \nScenario Cards in a different order.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 235    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\nElkhorn Coral Cards\nMyxococcales level: 4\nHeat resistance: 5\nDeep sea level: 7\nOxygen strength level: 8\nMyxococcales level: 2\nHeat resistance: 6\nDeep sea level: 5\nOxygen strength level: 7\nMyxococcales level: 1\nHeat resistance: 6\nDeep sea level: 3\nOxygen strength level: 2\nMyxococcales level: 8\nHeat resistance: 7\nDeep sea level: 7\nOxygen strength level: 7\nMyxococcales level: 0\nHeat resistance: 1\nDeep sea level: 1\nOxygen strength level: 3\nMyxococcales level: 2\nHeat resistance: 1\nDeep sea level: 3\nOxygen strength level: 3\nMyxococcales level: 4\nHeat resistance: 2 \nDeep sea level: 5\nOxygen strength level: 1\nMyxococcales level: 3\nHeat resistance: 6\nDeep sea level: 4\nOxygen strength level: 4\nMyxococcales level: 6\nHeat resistance: 5\nDeep sea level: 3\nOxygen strength level: 6\nMyxococcales level: 9\nHeat resistance: 8\nDeep sea level: 6\nOxygen strength level: 7\nMyxococcales level: 1\nHeat resistance: 4\nDeep sea level: 2\nOxygen strength level: 6\nMyxococcales level: 4\nHeat resistance: 6\nDeep sea level: 1\nOxygen strength level: 7\nFigure 6-11: Elkhorn Coral Cards.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 236    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\nScenario Cards\nScenario: Habitat Loss and Pollution\nRunoff from agricultural lands and other sources has polluted shallow waters. The \npollution makes it difficult for corals to grow in shallow waters and increases the \ngrowth of harmful algae. Only elkhorn corals that can live in deeper water can \nsurvive. \nAction: Discard all Elkhorn coral cards with deep sea levels 4, 3, 2, or 1.\nScenario: Climate Change\nOceans are warming due to climate change. This heat can stress coral and cause \ncoral bleaching. Some elkhorn coral live alongside helpful heat-resistant algae that \nhelp the corals survive even with coral bleaching.\nAction: Discard all elkhorn coral cards with heat resistance levels 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1.\nScenario: Invasive Species\nThe lionfish is an invasive species to the Caribbean. It eats fish that would usually \neat algae off coral. This upsets the reef ecosystem and means less oxygen is \navailable for coral. Some coral can survive on less oxygen.\nAction: Discard all elkhorn coral cards with oxygen strength levels 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1.\nScenario: Disease\nWhite band disease is spread by aquatic snails and stimulated by human pollution. \nIt destroys the coral tissue in elkhorn coral, slowly killing entire reefs. Only elkhorn \ncorals that support large amounts of a bacteria called Myxococcales will be able to \nsurvive. \nAction: Discard all Elkhorn coral cards with Myxococcales levels 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1.\nFigure 6-12: Scenario Cards.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 237    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nUnderstand: Can the tools of biotechnology help with conservation?\nYou know that people can have a negative impact on biodiversity. But there are also \nways people can help, for example, by reducing pollution or controlling invasive \nspecies. Biotechnology can also help preserve and restore genetic diversity. \n\t 1. Gather together with your team in a circle. The practice of conservation is about \nprotecting, preserving, and restoring biodiversity. Go around the circle three times \nand share any ideas you already have about ways people can take conservation \nactions. If you are not sure, that’s okay, you will learn more soon. Just do your best.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 238    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t a. First, share ways that people can protect biodiversity by stopping any further \ndamage to the environment.\nb. Second, share ways that people can preserve biodiversity by keeping the \ngenetic and species diversity that currently exists.\nc. Third, share ways that people can restore biodiversity by adding genetic, \nspecies, or ecosystem diversity back to the environment.\n\t\n\t\n\t 2. Read what Mary says. Why do you think biobanks might be a part of protecting, \npreserving, and restoring biodiversity? A biobank is a library of samples of \ndifferent organisms. Often these samples are cryopreserved, or frozen in a \nway that they can be thawed and still be alive. When a seed, egg, or tissue is \nbiobanked, it preserves the genetic diversity of that living things so it can be \nstudied or added back into an ecosystem in the future. \nMary says . . . \nBiodiversity stabilizes ecosystems and maintains them. Even \nwhen there are threats, adaptation is easier with higher levels of \nbiodiversity. We can preserve genetic and species biodiversity \nthrough biobanks. Once you put something in liquid nitrogen \nand it’s frozen but alive, it can stay there for tens or maybe \neven hundreds of years. So biobanks do buy us some time by \nmaintaining biodiversity and genetic diversity. \nIt’s so important to create biobanks because sometimes social processes can be \nslow, and changes in education and policies can take a long time. Biobanks can \ngive us that time to try and come to grips with what’s going on, and still not lose \nvast amounts of genetic diversity and biodiversity on the plant.\n\t 3. Take out the cards from the Genetic Diversity Card Game from the Discover \nactivity. You will now have a chance to play this game again, but with some tools \nfrom biotechnology to help you.\n4. Print and cut out the cards from Figures 6-13 and 6-14. If you cannot print the \ncards, you can write the information from the cards on a piece of paper and cut it \napart.\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 239    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\nBiotechnology: Biobanking\nBiobanking is a preservation technique that can store biological material, \nincluding DNA, for long periods of time. Scientists and researchers are able to \nstudy these preserved materials in controlled settings. They could also be used to \nreintroduce the biobanked genetic diversity back into an ecosystem.\nAction: Must be played before using the cloning and selective breeding cards.\nBiotechnology: Cloning\nCloning uses preserved cells and DNA to create copies of a previously existing \nliving thing. Scientists and researchers might use cloning to help introduce \ngenetic diversity into species that are endangered.\nAction: Choose three elkhorn coral cards to revive from your discarded pile. \n \nBiotechnology: Selective Breeding\nSelective breeding is when humans choose two animals within a species to mate, \nto try to produce offspring with desirable traits. Scientists can use biobanked \nmaterials to selectively breed elkhorn coral for more genetic diversity. \nAction: Choose two coral cards that are still in the game to represent parents, and \ntake a new blank Elkhorn Coral Card. Create a new Elkhorn Coral Card from your \nblank that uses the traits of the parents (Figure 6-15 shows an example). Add the \nnew card to the game. \nBiotechnology: Gene Drive\nGene drive is a technique using CRISPR that modifies specific genes and makes \nsure the modified genes are inherited by the next generation. Gene drives can \nchange the genetic makeup of a species over time. \nAction: Gene drive prevents the corallivorous snail from passing on white band \ndisease. All elkhorn corals remaining in the game cannot contract this disease.\nFigure 6-13: Biotechnology Cards.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 240    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMyxococcales level: \nHeat resistance: \nDeep sea level: \nOxygen strength level: \nMyxococcales level: \nHeat resistance: \nDeep sea level: \nOxygen strength level: \nMyxococcales level: \nHeat resistance: \nDeep sea level: \nOxygen strength level: \nMyxococcales level: \nHeat resistance: \nDeep sea level: \nOxygen strength level: \nFigure 6-14: Blank Elkhorn Coral Cards—use these to create new cards.\n(EXAMPLE PARENT 1)\nMyxococcales level: 4\nHeat resistance: 5\nDeep sea level: 7\nOxygen strength level: 8\n(EXAMPLE PARENT 2)\nMyxococcales level: 2\nHeat resistance: 6\nDeep sea level: 5\nOxygen strength level: 7\n(EXAMPLE NEW CORAL)\nMyxococcales level: 4\nHeat resistance: 6\nDeep sea level: 7\nOxygen strength level: 8\nFigure 6-15: Example of how a new coral card can inherit selected traits from two parent cards.\n5.

Read The Black-Footed Ferret Case Study.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 242    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\nThe Black-Footed Ferret Case Study\nBlack-footed ferrets once lived all over the prairies of North America. However, \nby the mid-1900s the species was declining rapidly because of human activities. \nScientists thought the ferrets were extinct, but managed to find one remaining \npopulation in the 1980s. To preserve the species, all of the remaining animals were \nbrought into captivity. Seven were able to breed and their DNA is the foundation \nfor today’s black-footed ferrets. Today around 10,000 black-footed ferrets are \ndescended from the original seven and many have been reintroduced into the wild.\nFigure 6-16: A black-footed ferret.\nHowever, the level of genetic diversity is very low, since all the black-footed ferrets \ncome from the original seven. Inbreeding, or producing offspring from close \nrelatives, means all the black-footed ferrets are genetically as closely related as \nhalf-siblings. When an individual has DNA from two closely related parents, the \nlikelihood of problems caused by genetic mutations increases. However, scientists \nare trying to increase the genetic diversity of the population through biotechnology.\nIn the 1980s scientists added frozen tissue from Willa, an unrelated black-footed \nferret, to a biobank. In 2020 Willa’s biobanked tissue was used to create a clone, \nElizabeth Ann. Willa and Elizabeth Ann are genetically identical. If Elizabeth Ann is \nbred with existing black-footed ferrets, her DNA can add genetic diversity to the \npopulation. As you learned with elkhorn corals, genetic diversity is very important \nfor species survival.\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 243    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t 2.

Since people caused the problems with the black-footed ferret population, do \nyou think they are responsible for helping to create a healthy population?\nb. Right now Elizabeth Ann lives in captivity. Would releasing her descendants \ninto the wild in the future be okay with you?\nc. Elizabeth Ann is a clone of Willa. But what if her genes had been genetically \nengineered to add the maximum amount of genetic diversity to the black-\nfooted ferret population? Would that be okay with you?\nd. Some scientists worry that if people know there is a way to add back genetic \ndiversity through biobanking, then they will not act quickly to stop problems \nlike habitat destruction or climate change. Do you agree?\ne. What if the black-footed ferrets were already extinct? Would it be okay to use \nbiotechnology tools to restore the population?\nf. In some countries, cloning as a technology is used frequently in livestock \nproduction (such as cows or pigs). Should the rules for cloning a wild species \nbe different than the rules for cloning a domesticated species?\n3. As a team, imagine you are in charge of creating a set of rules that would decide if \nand when a species can be restored, using biotechnologies such as cloning. Write \ndown the rules you decide on. Use what you have learned in this task to help you \nmake decisions. For example:\na. When should species be restored? Does the species have to be going extinct \nor just struggling?\nb. Which species should be restored? Does it make a difference how important \nhuman activities were in creating problems or how important the species is to \nan ecosystem?\nc. If it means a species will be restored, is it okay to release cloned individuals \ninto the wild?\nd. Is it okay to genetically engineer a species to survive better, such as adding an \nability to tolerate disease or heat?\ne. Who should be consulted when these decisions are being made?\nf. Who should be able to make the final decision?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 6 – Page 244    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 6 Task 2\n\t g. What other rules do you think should exist?\nh. Are there things that should be done now, like biobanking, to create options \nfor biodiversity restoration in the future?\n4. By yourself, apply those rules to your Conservation Plan. Does anything need to \nchange? Make those changes to your plan now.\n5. Read Mary’s ideas about the importance of conversations and other social \nprocesses to help the environment. Consider the conversations your team has \nhad, the rules you created, and your Conservation Plan. What do you think is most \nimportant to share with others?\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMary says . . . \nWe can’t just restore coral reefs because we have done \nbiobanking or selective breeding. The situation is more \ncomplex. You’ve got public perceptions and management \ndecisions, in addition to already existing global and local \nthreats. Those are the just a few of the factors. The public \ndoesn’t understand that we can do this one little piece \n(biobanking), but the big thing is how we think about helping the environment \nand restoring it. Things are more complicated when you consider the entire \ninteracting social aspects rather than just the scientific aspect.\n\t 6. Choose one group and share your rules or conservation plan with them. For \nexample:\na. Family and friends: You could have a conversation about the use of \nbiotechnology for conservation with family or friends. You could share the \nrules you created and ask others if they would create the same rules.\nb. Research scientists: You could find researchers working on the conservation of \nspecies you identified in the Understand activity. You could have a meeting or \nwrite them a letter and share both your conservation plan and the rules you \ndeveloped.\nc.

We use these physical differences \nto help identify one another. Biometrics is when this identification is automated by \nmeasuring the physical differences of individuals. Biometrics can be very useful, but \nthere are concerns that they can also be used in a harmful way. In this task you will first \ndiscover more about how you and your community are already using biometrics. Then \nyou will understand more about how biometrics work and design your own biometric \nsystem. Finally, you will consider the consequences of widespread biometrics use and \ndecide how you will use that information to act.   \nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Monique Mann. Monique (pronounced mo-NEEK) \nis one of the many researchers around the world trying to \nharness biotechnology to ethically improve security. As action \nresearchers you are also trying to ethically improve security \nthrough new technology. Monique will be your research mentor \nto help you understand more about the role biotechnology can \nplay in security.\nMonique is a senior lecturer on criminology. She has a PhD in the human rights \nimpacts of organized crime policing. However, she also has knowledge and \nperspectives that came from other parts of her identity. Since Monique is now \nworking with you, it is important to understand who she is. \nTo help you, Monique filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. \nMonique’s identity map includes the following things.\n• 34 years old\n• Caucasian\n• Female\n• Lives on the beach in Victoria, Australia\n• Interested in new technology, surveillance, and human rights\n• Likes yoga, surfing, going on adventures in nature, and camping\n• Longsighted, so wears glasses to read, has green eyes\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 256    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n• Curious\n• Dog lover: “I have two dogs that I love very much—Maxi is a Dalmatian and Felix \nis a German Shorthaired Pointer.”\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Monique’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Monique? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Monique? \n• Can you see anything about Monique’s identity, in addition to her university \ndegrees, that would help her understand different perspectives or ideas about \nsecurity? \nThroughout this task you will notice Monique sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. She may help you understand better ways to do your research or share some \nof the research she has done.\nDiscover: How do you use biometrics?\nThere are billions of people on Earth, and each person is unique. This variation is \nuseful in many ways. For example, variations among genes make it more likely for \nthe human population to have people who can resist a disease or live in a harsh \nenvironment. Variations among cultures can provide new approaches to problems. \nVariations among ideas can offer new solutions or breakthroughs. Variations in human \nappearance can help identify you as a specific individual. Using your biology in this \nway can be a useful tool for security. For example, biometrics can be used to make \nsure the right people have access to things like a phone, or information such as a bank \naccount statement.\nEarly humans lived in small groups and may have been able to recognize almost \neveryone they needed to interact with because they personally knew them. However, \nin modern times most people interact with many people they do not personally \nknow, often every day. How does someone know that you are you, and why is that \nimportant? In this activity you will start thinking about those questions for yourself \nand for your community.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 257    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t 1. Examine the zebras in Figure 7-1. At first you may think they seem identical, but \nexamine them closely. Do you notice any differences in the markings between the \ntwo zebras? Work with a partner and point out any differences you notice.\nFigure 7-1: How are these two zebras different?\n\t 2. Think quietly to yourself. Each zebra’s stripe pattern is unique. This means the \npattern can be used to identify a specific zebra. Are there things about your \nphysical appearance that are unique, like a zebra’s stripes? Create a list of physical \ntraits you think could be used as biometrics to uniquely identify you.\n3. One thing you may have listed is your fingerprints. Now you will take a few \nminutes to explore the differences between your fingerprints and your classmates’.\n4. Read Fingerprinting Activity Instructions.\n\t\n\t\nFingerprinting Activity Instructions\nFor this activity you will need a piece of white paper, a pencil, and a few pieces of \nclear adhesive tape.\n\t a. Near the top of the paper, use your pencil to shade in a small area.\nb. Rub your fingertip over the shaded area until the graphite from the pencil is \nall over the end of your finger.\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 258    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t c. Press your finger onto the sticky side of a piece of tape.\nd. Turn the tape over and stick it onto the bottom of the piece of paper.\ne. Repeat with different fingers, if you would like.\nf. Examine your fingerprint carefully. There are three main types of patterns you \nwill see—arches, loops, and whorls—but there is variation within these types. \nWhich type or types do you notice in your fingerprints?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFigure 7-2: Examples of arch patterns in fingerprints.\nFigure 7-3: Examples of left loop and right loop patterns in fingerprints.\nFigure 7-4: Examples of whorl patterns in fingerprints.\ng. Compare your fingerprints to those of your teammates, especially if they have \nthe same type of pattern as you. Are any of them exactly the same? \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 259    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t 5. Discuss with your teammates places or times you have noticed fingerprints being \nused to identify people. Have you ever had your fingerprints used to identify you?\n Emotional Safety Tip\nSometimes fingerprints can be used by police or other law enforcement \nofficers. You may have had your fingerprints taken or know someone \nwho had their fingerprints taken for this purpose. You may have strong \nfeelings about that experience. That is okay. You will be thinking later \nin this task about when you think biometrics such as fingerprints should \nbe used. But if you are upset now, it is okay to pause and take a break. \nIf you do not feel comfortable sharing about your experience with \nfingerprints, you do not need to share.\n\t 6. Go back to the list you made of traits about people that could be used to identify \nindividuals. Share your ideas with your teammates and build a group list. Think \ntogether about whether there is anything else to add. Be sure to consider:\na. Can you think of any biometrics that might rely on more than appearance? For \nexample, do you think humans may have unique sounds or smells?\nb. Are there ways to tell people apart if you have a sample of cells from their \nbody, like a drop of blood or a bit of saliva or a hair?\n7. Read Biometrics and Identity. \n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiometrics and Identity\nSome people think that physical items like keys or cards, or information like a \npassword or identification number, are not secure. Physical items or information \ncan be lost, stolen, or given to another person.\nWhat if instead you used the variations among humans as a security tool? There \nare many unique biometrics of humans that can help identify specific people. \nComputers can be programmed to identify you using your unique biometric \ninformation. The computer does this by comparing a sample of your biometric \ninformation (like your fingerprint) against a database of many people’s biometric \ninformation, until the computer finds a match. Some biometric databases, or sets \nof information, include more than one billion samples.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 260    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\nPhysical appearance\nBiometrics are most commonly related to physical appearance, such as:\n• Fingerprints\n• Facial recognition\n• Iris (eye) scan\n• Palm prints\n• The pattern of your veins (vascular biometrics)\nFigure 7-5: Examples of biometric types, including face, voice, and iris.\nOther biometrics\nTools to identify other biometrics are sometimes used as well, such as:\n• Voice recognition\n• Gait analysis (the way you walk)\n• DNA analysis\n\t 8. Think about the different types of biometrics and your experience with them. If \nyou are comfortable, tell your teammates about a time you had a biometric used \nto identify you.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 261    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t 9. With your team, discuss any examples you can think of related to how biometrics \nmight be used to:\na. Allow you to access or not access specific places\nb. Allow you to access specific things that you own or use\nc. Allow you to access or not access specific data or information\nd. Find out who was or is in a specific place\n 10. Have each team member pick one type of biometric from the Biometrics and \nIdentity box and share with the team the advantages and disadvantages  \nrelated to:\na. How accurate you think it is, like could it be used to identify you without \nmistaking you for someone else\nb. Whether it could be used without your knowledge\nc. Whether there are physical differences that might make this biometric \nimpossible to use for someone, such as if a person is missing a finger and the \nbiometric is a fingerprint\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRead Monique’s thoughts on collecting data through biometrics. Why might \npeople be concerned about having data about themselves collected through \nbiometrics?\nMonique says . . . \nI think people really need to be aware of what’s happening \nin terms of why their information is being collected and how \nit’s being used, stored, shared, and analyzed. Often when you \ncome to terms of use or service, you just click “accept” and \nyou don’t know what that really means. There are definitely \npositive applications of biometric technology. But we need to \nthink about collecting data for a specific purpose and only that \npurpose, and then deleting it when that purpose has been met.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 262    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\nUnderstand: How is your face used to identify you?\nThere are many types of biometrics, but for most of them you have to individually scan \nsomething—like an eye, a fingerprint, or a DNA sample. Facial recognition technology \nis a little different. It can scan many people very quickly. It can be used in a public area \nand sometimes without people’s knowledge. In this activity you will learn more about \nhow it works and think about ways in which it can be used.\n\t 1. Read Facial Recognition.\nFacial Recognition\nThink of your face as a map. In facial recognition technology the features that \nstand out easily, like your nose, eyes, and mouth, are called landmarks. Facial \nrecognition works by creating points at different parts of the landmarks and then \nmeasuring the space between them. For example, maybe the space between \ntwo edges of an eye or the space between an upper lip and the bottom of a \nnose could be measured. Figure 7-6 shows some examples. The white dots are \nlandmarks, and the lines measure the space between them. \nFigure 7-6: Examples of facial recognition landmarks.\nOnce the distance between landmarks is measured, this is compared to existing \ndata to locate a match. \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 263    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nSometimes it is compared to one existing biometric scan to verify that the \nscanned person is the right person. This is called one-to-one facial recognition. \nThis is the way facial recognition on phones works, for example. Your phone \ncontains a stored copy of your facial recognition scan that it matches to your face \nto unlock your phone. \nFigure 7-7:  Using a phone for facial recognition.\nSometimes an image is compared to a large database of images to identify \nsomeone. This is called one-to-many facial recognition. An example of this would \nbe using facial recognition in law enforcement to identify someone suspected of \ncommitting a crime. \n2. Think like a biometric designer and share your answers to these questions with \nyour team.\na. What would be some of the difficulties in measuring landmarks on a face?\nb. Which landmarks do you think you would use on a human face?\n3. Now you will have a chance to create a facial recognition biometric using non-\nhuman faces. Pick one of the wild cat pictures shown in Figure 7-8. \n4. If you are using a printed version of these pictures, either lay a piece of paper that \nyou can see through over the picture you picked or hold the picture up to the \nwindow and put a piece of paper over it. If you are using this guide digitally, put \na piece of paper over the screen. Use a pencil to lightly mark dots on the edges of \nmajor facial landmarks. Use 10 dots or less. Do not show anyone else which cat you \nare using to create your biometric scan. \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 264    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\nFigure 7-8: Wild cat pictures.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 265    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 5. Put your paper back on a flat surface and use a straight edge to connect the dots \nto create a biometric scan. Figure 7-9 shows an example.\nFigure 7-9: A facial recognition biometric of the tiger picture.\n6. Switch biometric scans with a partner. Can you both identify which cat you used to \ncreate your biometric scan?\n7. Discuss with your team:\na. What was difficult about this activity?\nb. Do you think some of the cats are harder to create facial scans of than others? \nIf so, why? \n8. Now create a biometric scan of the tiger face in Figure 7-10. You may need to use \nmore dots to create landmarks. Try to use as few as possible.\nFigure 7-10: Tiger face.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 266    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n9.\tCompare your biometric to the animals shown in Figure 7-11. Can you find a \nmatch? Do not use the picture to compare—only your biometric scan. Compare \nyour answer to those of your teammates.\nFigure 7-11: Wild cat biometric database.\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 267    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t\nBias and Facial Recognition\nFacial recognition currently does not work equally well for all groups. \nFor example, for people with darker skin or wearing makeup, many facial \nrecognition scanners may have trouble figuring out where to place the facial \nlandmarks. Computers scan many reference photos to learn to recognize the \ndifferences between faces. But if these reference photos are too similar, like the \npeople in them come from largely one ethnic group or gender, then sometimes \nthe computer will become better at identifying the differences among people \nfrom that group than among people from other groups. These problems with \nthe technology creates bias, a situation in which specific groups are treated \nunequally.\nThere is also another problem of bias in facial recognition. If there are many \npeople who look like you in a database, you are more likely to be falsely identified \nas a match, known as a false positive. \nYou may have just created a false positive in the last activity. Did you find a match \nfor your tiger biometric? None of the tigers in Figure 7-11 match your biometric \nscan. Yet, because there were so many tigers present in the database, you or \nsomeone in your team may have identified a match.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 268    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\nMonique says . . . \nOne-to-many facial recognition uses databases to identify \nunknown persons. Often one-to-many is also used in a \nchanging, live environment, like tracking someone as they \nmove in a public space through CCTV (closed-circuit television) \nor security cameras. In those situations, facial recognition has \nbeen demonstrated to be biased against people of color and \nparticularly women of color. Part of this is due to the algorithms and the data sets \nused to train the computer to make a match. The other issue is the data used to \ncreate the database. For example, if you use photos taken when people are arrested, \nif you have groups, like people of color, that are disproportionately overrepresented \nin things such as the criminal justice system, then that bias also becomes part of the \ndatabase and the facial recognition system.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMonique says . . . \nWe are all under surveillance and it is not just from the \ngovernment and law enforcement; the ones who are really \nthe best at facial recognition is companies, like social media \ncompanies. If you have a social media account where you upload \npictures, often these pictures can be used to create a biometric \ntemplate and added to a facial recognition database. Sometimes \nthese databases can be accessed by law enforcement agencies. \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 269    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\nCompanies also use this information to develop profiles about people to target \nadvertising at them to convince them to buy things. Biometrics have the potential \nto link your physical presence in real life and potentially all this other information \nout there about you that’s held in databases or on the Internet.\nAct: How should we be using biometrics?\nBiometrics can be a useful tool to identify people. In this activity you will consider \nethical concerns with using biometrics and create a set of rules for when and how \nbiometrics should be used. \n\t 1. Look at the Ethical Concerns List you created in Part 1 and then read what Monique \nsays. Are there any ethical concerns that might relate to using biometrics? Use \nthese ideas in the next activity.\nMonique says . . . \nWe must be really mindful of the context and purpose of using \na technology and what that means for individuals in society. \nWith biometrics there are clear risks in terms of violation of \nfundamental human rights: not only the right to privacy, \nbut many others, like freedom of political expression, anti-\ndiscrimination, and freedom of association [the freedom \nto join together with others to express or defend similar interests]. Privacy is a \nfoundational right that is needed for all these other rights.\n\t 2. Read Biometrics Situations. Assign each team member a situation or create your \nown situations. Think about the situation and share with your team:\na. Which ethical issues might be a part of this situation?\nb. Do you think a biometric tool should be used? Why or why not?\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 270    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t c. If you choose to use a biometric tool, which one would you use? For example, \nwould you use facial recognition, iris, palm prints, fingerprints, voice, gait analysis, \nor DNA?\nBiometrics Situations\n\t a. There is a large sporting event that many people attend and you are searching \nfor any wanted criminals.\nb. You own a company that has sensitive information stored inside the building \nwhere employees work.\nc. You design a country’s border controls and you want to make sure you know \nwho is entering and leaving your country.\nd. You work for local law enforcement and you are searching for a missing child.\ne. You have a banking system that people need to securely access online.\nf. You own a large shop and would like to make payment options more \nconvenient. \ng. You work at a social media site and want to make it easy to identify people in \nphotos that are posted.\nh. You want to stop vandalism in a downtown park.\ni. You want to find an easy and secure way for people to access their \nsmartphones.\nj. You are trying to advertise your products and want to be able to personalize \nthe billboards people see.\nk. You want to have your phone or personal home device recognize your voice \nwhen you ask it a question out loud. \nl. You are a school leader and want to make sure only students and staff are \npresent in the school building.\n\t\nYou work for a transit authority and want to find a way to cut down on lines to \ngo through entry control.\nn. You are trying to identify bodies of people killed in a natural disaster.\no. You are a government worker and many people are protesting something the \ngovernment has done. You would like to find out more about who is part of \nthe protest.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 271    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t 3. Think quietly to yourself. Do some people on your team have different \nperspectives on when biometrics should be used? Why is what others think \nimportant when considering biometrics?\n4. Different places are making very different rules when it comes to facial \nrecognition. Read Monique’s ideas to find out more.\n\t\nMonique says . . . \nDifferent places have different rules for data protection and \nprivacy. For example, there are proposals in the European Union \nto ban facial recognition or limit the use of facial recognition in \npublic spaces unless it is in certain extreme conditions, like a \nmissing child or an imminent terrorist attack. Other places it is \nmore unregulated and, for example, companies can film you if \nthey just put a little sign up somewhere saying they are doing it. People may not \neven be aware, and they may or may not know exactly what’s happening. \n\t 5. Read these three facial recognition rules. Pick the rule that would make you most \ncomfortable. Discuss with your team why you picked the one you picked.\na. A country has decided not to use facial recognition at all in public areas to \nstop any abuses and protect people’s privacy.\nb. A country uses some facial recognition in public areas and allows a facial \nrecognition database to be built from the driver’s license pictures of some \npeople from the country.\nc. A country uses facial recognition widely. Public spaces and transportation \nare all monitored using facial recognition to stop any crime and ensure that \npeople are who they say they are.\n6. Think to yourself: If you had to make the rules about when and how biometrics \ncould be used, what rules would you make? Write down or find another way to \nrecord your answer. Be sure to consider:\na. Should biometrics be used when people are not aware they are being used?\nb. How do you protect people from false positive identifications?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 272    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 1\n\t c. Are there certain places it is okay for biometrics to be used? Do think certain \nother places are not okay?\nd. Is it okay for biometrics to track you as you move around during the day?\ne. Who should be able to access collections of biometrics data and how long \nshould the data be kept?\nf. How should biometrics databases be built? For example, should you have to \nagree to participate? Or should the database include only people who have \nbeen arrested? Or should you be allowed to pull pictures that were posted on \nsocial media to create the database?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 7. Why do you think it is important to talk to others about these ideas? Read \nMonique’s thoughts and consider what conversation you would like to have about \nthe use of biometrics.\nMonique says . . . \nI think we need a broader consultation and community \ndiscussion about the role of technology in our lives and the \ntype of society we want to live in. There are both positive and \nnegative applications of biometric technology. We should \nthink about the kind of values we’re embedding in technology \nand the way we’re using it. What does it mean if we live in a \nsurveillance state where technology can be used to surveil and control the entire \npopulation? What are we trying to achieve in terms of the type of society we want \nto live in and the appropriate protections for human rights? \n\t 8. Discuss your thoughts on biometrics rules with a friend or family member later \ntoday or tomorrow. Do they have some ideas or concerns that are different from \nyours? Listen carefully to understand why they might have a different perspective \nfrom you, and carefully explain your perspective.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 273    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nPart 7 Task 2\nTask 2: What are the threats to security presented by \nbiotechnology? \nBiotechnology uses living things, parts of living things, or things produced by living \nthings to solve people’s problems and meet their needs. Sometimes this means \nengineering new or modified organisms through selective breeding or genetic \nmodification. Sometimes this means moving biological systems or organisms to \nnew places or using them in new ways to create things or perform services that are \nuseful to people. As you have learned, both of these biotechnological approaches \ncreate tremendous opportunities for better human health, food, materials, and more \nsustainable resource use. These approaches also create potential threats to a secure \nfuture for people and the planet. \nIn this task you will be learning about those threats and how you can help prevent \nthem. First you will discover ways in which biotechnology might cause harm. Then you \nwill investigate vulnerabilities in your community to understand more about ways to \nguard against these threats. Finally, you will act to share this information with others in \nyour community.\nMeet Your Research Mentor\nMeet Dr. Zabta Shinwari. Zabta (pronounced ZAB-tah) is one of \nthe many researchers around the world trying to protect the \nplanet from threats from biotechnology. As action researchers \nyou are doing the same. Zabta will be your research mentor \nto help you understand more about the possible threats from \nbiotechnology.\nZabta is professor emeritus at Quad-i-Azam University in Pakistan and a former \nsecretary-general of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences. He is a specialist in \nbiotechnology and biosecurity and received the 2015 UNESCO Avicenna Prize \nfor Ethics in Science. However, he also has knowledge and perspectives that \ncame from other parts of his identity. Since Zabta is now working with you, it is \nimportant to understand who he is. \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 274    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nTo help you, Zabta filled out an identity map, just like you did in Part 1. Zabta’s \nidentity map includes the following things.\n• Born in the Shinwari tribe on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan\n• Tall, with black hair and fair skin\n• Likes to travel, chat with friends, walk in the wilderness\n• Funny, kind, and sensitive\n• Committed to extending higher education to neglected communities in \nPakistan\n• Born into a big family—seven brothers and a sister!\n• Married another Pakhtoon (his ethnicity) and they have five daughters and two sons\n• Four of his daughters got PhDs, which makes him very proud!\n• Interested in working with Indigenous communities in Pakistan, trying to \nsafeguard their knowledge and find ways to reduce poverty\n• Likes to write—has published nine books and 445 articles\nBefore you begin this task, think quietly to yourself about Zabta’s identity map. \n• Are there things you have in common with Zabta? \n• Are there ways in which you are different from Zabta? \n• Can you see anything about Zabta’s identity, in addition to his university \ndegrees, that would help him understand different perspectives or ideas about \nbiotechnology and security?\nThroughout this task you will notice Zabta sharing ideas and experiences with \nyou. He may help you understand better ways to do your research or share some \nof the research he has done.\nDiscover: How could biotechnology be harmful?\nEvery day you probably think about the future and risk. For example, if you are \nthinking about your day and know that you are going to be out at lunchtime, you may \nthink there is a risk you will be hungry and so you take a snack. Or if you are walking \nnear a busy road you may think there is a risk you will be injured by a car, so you stay \naway from the edge. Thinking about what is likely to happen in the future is called \nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 275    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nforesight. In this activity you will use foresight as a tool to think about possible futures \nof different biotechnology tools. \n\t 1. Take a paper and divide it into two columns. Title the first column “Helpful.” Title \nthe second column “Harmful.” \n2. Read Scenario One quietly to yourself. Each scenario in this section is based on a \nreal-world event. For more information, see the Biotechnology! StoryMap.\n\t\nScenario One\nA group of scientists is researching ways that viruses might mutate to become \nmore dangerous. They use biotechnology tools to produce targeted mutations \nto create viruses that are more harmful to humans so they can understand how \nto fight these viruses. These genetically engineered viruses and the information \nabout them are kept in secure labs. If the viruses were out of the lab and \nspreading in the population, there would be risks to human health. \n\t 3. Discuss with your team the possible future outcomes you can think of for this \nscenario. An outcome is the end result or consequence of something. Think about \nthe possible ways the situation described in the scenario could create outcomes \nthat benefit or hurt people and the planet. Write or draw your ideas in the \nappropriate column. \na. Helpful: What are the possible future outcomes that could help people or the \nplanet? List them on this column.\nb. Harmful: What are the possible future outcomes that could harm people or the \nplanet? List outcomes might harm a few people or other living things in this \ncolumn, or could hurt many people or whole ecosystems.\n\t\n\t\n Emotional Safety Tip\nThinking about terrible things that might happen in the future can be \nscary and stressful. No bad outcomes or catastrophic outcomes are already \ndecided. By understanding issues that concern you now, you can become \npart of the effort to prevent these outcomes. Scientists and others around \nthe world are also working hard to prevent these types of outcomes.\nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 276    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 4. Read Zabta’s thoughts. Do his ideas make you think of any additional possible \nhelpful or harmful outcomes? If so, add those to your list now.\nZabta says . . .  \nUsing biotechnology and gene editing is getting easier. It is \ngetting easier to modify viruses. This means more researchers \nhave access to this technology and there is more possibility of \nviruses getting out of a research setting. It is important to make \npeople aware of ways that biotechnology can be misused, to \nunderstand how it can become dangerous. Viruses don’t respect \nborders. Once a virus is circulating in a population, it can go anywhere, as we \nlearned with COVID-19.\n\t 5. Read Scenarios Two, Three, Four, and Five by yourself. For each scenario, record \nthings that could be helpful and harmful in the appropriate column on your paper. \nMake sure you consider how diseases, pests, and misinformation can spread and \nhow that can affect human and animal health, the environment, and economies.\nScenario Two\nMany farms around the world raise pigs for meat. Sometimes equipment, people, \nor feed goes from one farm to another. Recently some pigs have been getting \nvery sick with a disease that kills most of them within 20 days. The disease does \nnot harm humans, even if they eat meat from infected pigs. There is a risk that \nthis disease could spread between pigs in different farms, affecting farmers, \nconsumers, and the whole economy.\nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 277    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nScenario Three\nIn one country the main staple food is maize (or corn). Although they grow a lot \nof maize, this country also imports it from other places. One of those places is on \nanother continent. Maize growers on that continent are struggling because there \nis an insect that attacks and eats their crops. There is a risk that this insect could \nspread to the country through the imported maize. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nScenario Four\nScientists are able to use biotechnology to rapidly create useful and safe vaccines, \ndrugs, and therapies to help prevent and cure illnesses. However, there is \nmisunderstanding and misinformation about these technologies, leading to a \nlot of fear and suspicion about using the vaccines, drugs, or therapies. There is a \nrisk that this misinformation could spread among people and lead them to make \ndecisions that are not good for their health.\nScenario Five\nThe ability to rapidly sequence DNA and develop therapies that target specific \nsequences of DNA is revolutionizing medicine. Yet there is a risk that scientists \ncould use DNA sequences to create a bio-weapon that would target a specific \nperson or a group of closely related people, such as a family or ethnic group. \n6. Compare your Helpful and Harmful lists with your team members. \na. Are there some outcomes other team members thought of that you would like \nto add to your lists? You can do that now.\nb. How could some of the things that might happen help or harm you \npersonally?\n7. Consider the harmful outcomes you listed. Examine your Futures Mood Board \nfrom Part 1. Add any new concerns you now have. In the next activity you will be \nthinking about how to stop those outcomes from happening.\nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 278    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nUnderstand: How can we keep ourselves safe?\nSome biotechnology tools and research can be called dual use technologies. Dual \nuse technologies can be used for a good or helpful purpose, like to prevent and fight \nillness, to make people healthier, or to protect food systems. These biotechnologies \ncan also have the potential to create harm, like to create viruses that could causes \ndiseases in humans or other living things. \nThe harmful outcomes you identified in the Discover activity can also be called  \nbio-threats. Bio-threats can be caused by mistakes people make, or bio-error. They \ncan also be caused deliberately to create harm; this is called bio-terror. \n\t 1. Reread the Scenarios from the Discover activity. You are going to create a Process \nMap of steps that might lead to the harmful outcomes you identified. \n2. Divide your team into four groups and assign each group a scenario from one \nto four. For each scenario, map out the process of different steps that might lead \nto harmful outcomes. Figure 7-12 shows an example using Scenario Five. Use a \ndifferent scenario to create your own Process Map.\n\t\nFigure 7-12: Mapping the process that leads to harmful outcomes from Scenario Five.\n\t 3. For each step in this process, consider ways this might happen. Write or draw them \non the Process Map.\na. Think about bio-error possibilities—ways mistakes might be made that lead to \nharmful outcomes. List or draw those ideas above your Process Map. You may \nwant to use another color pen or marker.\nb. Think about bio-terror possibilities—ways someone might deliberately cause \na harmful outcome. List or draw those ideas below your Process Map. You may \nwant to use another color pen or marker.\n\t\n\t\nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 279    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 4. Now examine your Process Map. For each step think about how you could prevent \nthe next step from happening if:\na. The problem was bio-error: Write or draw those ideas next to the bio-error \npossibilities on the Process Map.\nb. The problem was bio-terror: Write or draw those ideas next to the bio-terror \npossibilities on the Process Map.\n5. Have each group share their Process Map with the rest of the team.\n6. Discuss with your team:\na. Are there ways you personally might be able to help stop bio-error or bio-terror?\nb. Are there other people, organizations, or governments you think could help \nstop bio-error or bio-terror?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nZabta says . . .  \nEducation is important. Science is a public good. We need to \nthink together about how to be good citizens and good human \nbeings. We need to think carefully about the information we \nspread; information itself can become a weapon if it stops \npeople from acting safely.\nI work with international organizations to help coordinate \nscientists working to stop bio-threats. I work with groups of scientists around the \nworld. But I also work with students in my country because everyone needs to \nunderstand that they have a part to play in keeping our world safe. \n\t 7. Sit in a circle with your team. One by one go around the circle and list places or \nthings in your local community that might be vulnerable to bio-threats such as \ndisease or invasive pests. Be sure to consider:\na. Human health \nb. Shared food or water sources\nc. Your local economy \nd. Your local natural environment\ne. Places in your community, like laboratories, where biotechnology research is \nhappening\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 280    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n8. Pick one vulnerability to investigate further. Then read the Bio-Threat Vulnerability \nInvestigation Instructions. \nBio-Threat Vulnerability Investigation Instructions\nConsider how you can find out more about the vulnerability your team picked. \nMake sure you find out:\n\t 1. What are the bio-threats to this vulnerability?\n2. How serious are they?\n3. How can they be prevented?\n4. How might you help?\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPossible methods to find this information \n\t a. Online: Check for government, scientific, or news websites that contain \ndetails about the vulnerability you are thinking about. For example, if you are \ninvestigating what might threaten a crop lots of farmers in your area grow, you \ncould search for potential diseases or invasive pests that would hurt that crop.\nb. In print: Many bio-threats have been around for years. You may be able to use \na library or other place to learn more.\nc. Contact a local organization: Is there an organization in your community that \nhelps support the thing or place you are investigating? They might have a lot \nof useful information. You can search for any documents they share with the \npublic. Or you can contact them and ask to interview them.\nd. Interview a scientist: A scientist who studies the bio-threat might be a good \nsource of information. You can contact them and ask to interview them.\ne. Another method: Be creative. Maybe you know another way to get the \ninformation you need.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nTips for conducting an interview\n\t a. Make sure to ask permission to record a person’s answers. \nb. Ask permission to share the interview with the rest of your team, class, or \nother people in the community. People might be more willing to share if their \ninterview is anonymous. \n\t\n\t\nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 281    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t c. If it feels as if someone didn’t answer your question, don’t be afraid to ask the \nquestion again in a different way. \nd. Let the person you are interviewing answer the questions in the way they \nwant. Be patient. Listen carefully. Understand that they might give answers \nyou didn’t ask for or expect. \n\t\nSafety tips for interviewing people\nAsk your teacher for guidelines. They will know what is safest in your community. \n Physical Safety Tip\nNever conduct an interview alone and always be aware of your \nsurroundings. You might want to suggest recording the interview in a \nquiet public place.\n Emotional Safety Tip\nIt can be hard to communicate with other people in the community. You \nmay feel shy or nervous. Someone may tell you they don’t want to talk. \nThat’s okay! It doesn’t have anything to do with you. It just means they \ndon’t want to share. You can show them respect by thanking them and \nmoving on to another person. \n\t 9. Pick one or more methods to conduct your investigation.\na. Decide who on your team will do what. Remember, including everyone \nis important. Try to pick methods that allow everyone on your team to \nparticipate in some way.\nb. Make notes or find other ways to record what you learn about the bio-threat \nduring your investigation.\n\t\n\t\nPart 7 Task 2 \nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 282    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nAct: How can we work toward a safe future?\nHaving foresight and understanding the threats to your community is important. This \nallows you and others to take action to combat these threats. In this activity you will \nthink about how to share what you have learned with others.\nZabta says . . . \nYouth can be change managers. People need to gain \nawareness and realize that they can anticipate things and \ntake responsibility for the future. We need to think as a whole \nspecies, what will help us survive and do well? I wish the world \nleadership would change the phrase “national interest” into \n“human interest,” because we are all connected. \nPart 7 Task 2 \n1. Take out your notes from your bio-threat investigation in the Understand activity.\n2. Discuss with your team, who in your community do you think should know more \nabout this vulnerability? Pick one audience to focus on. For example, do you want to \nshare what you have learned with other young people, with adults, with people who \nwork in a specific type of job, people who live in a specific place, or another group?\n3. Consider the audience you chose. What is your goal in communicating with them? \nFor example, do you want them to just be more aware of the threat, do you want \nthem to be more careful, do you want them to create a law or regulation, do you \nwant them to understand how their actions affect other people, or do you want \nthem to do something else?\n4. Decide on your message. What are the most important ideas to share? Think about \nthe information you gathered and the harmful outcomes you listed in the Discover \nactivity. Choose information that will lead your audience toward your goal.\n5. Design the message. What would be the best way to share this information? Be creative! \nFor example, maybe you could create a poster or infographic, you could record a \nshort video to share on social media, you could use a podcast to tell a story about the \nvulnerability, you could create a meme, or choose another way to reach your audience.\nBiotechnology!     Part 7 – Page 283    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n6. Take the message you designed and share it with your audience.\n7. Reflect with your team about the process of creating and sharing your message. \nDiscuss:\na. What went well?\nb. What could have gone better?\nc. What would you do differently next time?\nCongratulations! \nYou have finished Part 7.\nFind out More!\nFor additional resources and activities, please visit the Biotechnology!

Then you will put those plans into action.\nIn this task you will discover more about your and your community’s hopes for the \nfuture. Then you will understand more about your role in working toward those goals. \nFinally, you will act on your ideas and work toward a sustainable and positive future.\nDiscover: How do I want biotechnology to be used in the future?\nBefore you decide what you want to do, you need to think about what you want to \naccomplish. Many different futures are possible. Which one do you want to work toward? \n\t 1. Take out your Futures Mood Board from Task 1.\n2. With your team, think about everything you have learned in this guide. Is there \nanything you would like to add to your Futures Mood Board? If so, add it now.\n3. By yourself, examine the Futures Mood Board. Pick one part of the future that \nrelates to biotechnology that you would like to work toward. It could be a concern \nyou have about the future that you want to avoid, or it could be a hope about the \nfuture that you want to encourage.\n4. Share your ideas with your team.\n5. As a team, come to consensus on one part of the future you want to take action \non. A consensus is a balanced decision that works for everyone in the group. \nThere are many ways to come to consensus. Here are some ideas. You can choose \nwhatever works best for your team.\na. List the good things and bad things about taking action for each future. \nDiscuss as a team.\nb. Try to find the same values. Are there some ideas about the future that are \nsimilar? Try to combine them.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPart 8 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 8 – Page 291    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t c. Build a sense of the group opinion. Are there some ideas about the future that \nmany people would be interested in working toward?\nd. Find a slow consensus. Find a partner and as a pair find consensus on which \nfuture idea is most important. Then in a group of two pairs (four team \nmembers) you can build consensus among the four of you. Then in a group of \nfour pairs (eight team members) you can discuss further to build consensus. \nKeep adding groups together until you have found a team consensus.\ne. Consider your impact. Think about who would benefit from your team \nworking toward a specific idea about the future. Which group are you most \ninterested in helping?\n6. Once you have chosen a future you want to work toward, you need to think of \nan action to take that might help create that future. Get out a piece of paper and \nwrite or draw any actions you can think of. If you are having trouble thinking of \nactions you can take, here are some ideas you may want to consider. \na. Personal: Could you personally become involved in discovering and using \nbiotechnologies? You have learned about many types of STEM careers from \nyour research mentors. Choose the one that interests you the most and figure \nout how you could follow that career path.  \nb. Educate others: Other people you know may not know much about \nbiotechnology. Could you choose a group to educate to help them learn more?\nc. Communicate with your community: Help your community understand a part \nof biotechnology or a concern you have by designing posters, composing \nsongs, recording podcasts, making public service announcements, setting up \na social media campaign, or using other ways to communicate. \nd. Government change: Try to change the rules your local or national \ngovernment has about biotechnology. For example, you could write letters to \nofficials or speak at local government meetings to share the actions you think \nare necessary to create the future you want.\ne. Global change: Collaborate with others around the world who are worried \nabout the same problem. For example, join a group that is using biotechnology \nfor sustainability or a group that represents any concerns you have.\nf. Come up with your own ideas! \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPart 8 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 8 – Page 292    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\nUnderstand: What will my role be?\nNow it is time to plan your action. As you have learned, variations among people’s \nperspectives and abilities can make the whole team stronger. Think about what role \nyou will take to help with the team action.\n\t 1. Take out your Identity Map from Part 1 and examine it closely. Make a note of \nthings about your identity that might help you decide how you would like to act. \nFor example:\na. Are you part of any groups that you could communicate with?\nb. Do you have any special talents, such as art or music, that might be useful to \ncapture people’s attention?\nc. Are you interested in science and engineering or other ways to try to find \ninnovative solutions?\nd. Do you have good planning or organizational skills?\ne. Are there other things about your identity that might help you work toward \nthe future you want?\n2. Gather with your team. Write “Team Strengths” on a sheet of paper or on the \nboard.\n3. Under Team Strengths, write down all the ideas each person had about things from \ntheir identity that might help you all act.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n Emotional Safety Tip\nEveryone has strengths and weaknesses. As a team member, sharing \nyour unique strengths is important, even if it feels uncomfortable. It is \nimportant to respect your own strengths and to respect what others \nidentify as their strengths.\n\t 4. As a team, discuss the actions you thought of in the Discover activity. Remove any \nactions that would not be helpful or that you cannot do.\nPart 8 Task 1\nBiotechnology!     Part 8 – Page 293    © 2022  Smithsonian Institution\n\t 5. Share your ideas and listen to others. Come to a consensus about which action \nyou will take, using your Team Strengths list to help you decide the best action for \nyour team. You can use some of the consensus-building ideas from the Discover \nactivity, if you want.\n6. Think quietly to yourself about the steps that could be part of planning the action \nyour team picked. \n7. Write, draw, or use another way to record your ideas on small pieces of paper. Each \npiece of paper should have one step. \n8. Have each team member share their steps by placing their pieces of paper on a \ntable or by using a digital tool for collaboration.\n9. Read through the steps from your teammates.\na. Did you notice any steps that were similar to yours?\nb. Do you think your team is missing any steps?\n 10. Start to organize your team’s steps. You can move the pieces of paper around as \nyou do this. Thinking about your team’s steps will help you decide how you will \ntake action.\na. Group any similar steps together. \nb. Remove any steps you don’t think are needed to help your team take action. \nc. Think about how each team member will help. Put their names with the steps \nthey would like to help with. \nd. Think about what steps might be missing. Add those steps.\n 11. Put the steps in order. For example, what do you think the team needs to do first? \nPlace that piece of paper before all the others.\n 12. Title a sheet of paper “Action Plan” and record the following:\na. The steps your team would like to take\nb. The order of those steps\nc. Who will help with each step (it might be more than one person)\nd. When and where you will take these steps\ne.

By publishing this report, the Board intends to promote public understand-\ning by increasing transparency around, and creating accountability for, the Federal Reserve’s \nviews on this topic. Financial stability supports the objectives assigned to the Federal Reserve, \nincluding full employment and stable prices, a safe and sound banking system, and an efficient \npayments system.\nA financial system is considered stable when \nbanks, other lenders, and financial markets \nare able to provide households, communities, \nand businesses with the financing they need \nto invest, grow, and participate in a well-­\nfunctioning economy—and can do so even \nwhen hit by adverse events, or “shocks.”\nConsistent with this view of financial stabil-\nity, the Federal Reserve Board’s monitoring \nframework distinguishes between shocks to, \nand vulnerabilities of, the financial system. \nShocks are inherently difficult to predict, \nwhile vulnerabilities, which are the aspects \nof the financial system that would exacerbate \nstress, can be monitored as they build up or \nrecede over time. As a result, the framework \nfocuses primarily on assessing vulnerabilities, \nwith an emphasis on four broad categories \nand how those categories might interact to \namplify stress in the financial system.1\n1\t For a review of the research literature in this area, see Tobias Adrian, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang (2015),  \n“Financial Stability Monitoring,” Annual Review of Financial Economics, vol. 7 (December), pp. 357–95.\n1.\t Valuation pressures arise when asset prices are high relative to economic fundamentals or\nhistorical norms. These developments are often driven by an increased willingness of investors\nto take on risk. As such, elevated valuation pressures may increase the possibility of outsized\ndrops in asset prices (see Section 1, Asset Valuations).\nPurpose and Framework\nMore on the Federal \nReserve’s Monitoring Efforts\nSee the Financial Stability section of the \n­Federal Reserve Board’s website for more \ninformation on how the Federal Reserve \nmonitors the stability of the U.S. and world \nfinancial systems.\nThe website includes:\n•\t a more detailed look at our monitoring\nframework for assessing risk in each\n­category;\n•\t more data and research on related topics;\n•\t information on how we coordinate, cooper-\nate, and otherwise take action on financial\nsystem issues; and\n•\t public education resources describing the\nimportance of our efforts.\nvi\t\nFinancial Stability Report\n2.\tExcessive borrowing by businesses and households exposes the borrowers to distress if \ntheir incomes decline or the assets they own fall in value. In these cases, businesses and \nhouseholds with high debt burdens may need to cut back spending, affecting economic activity \nand causing losses for investors (see Section 2, Borrowing by Businesses and Households).\n3.\tExcessive leverage within the financial sector increases the risk that financial institutions will \nnot have the ability to absorb losses without disruptions to their normal business operations \nwhen hit by adverse shocks. In those situations, institutions will be forced to cut back lending, \nsell their assets, or even shut down. Such responses can impair credit access for households \nand businesses, further weakening economic activity (see Section 3, Leverage in the \nFinancial Sector).\n4.\tFunding risks expose the financial system to the possibility that investors will rapidly \nwithdraw their funds from a particular institution or sector, creating strains across markets \nor institutions. Many financial institutions raise funds from the public with a commitment \nto return their investors’ money on short notice, but those institutions then invest much of \nthose funds in assets that are hard to sell quickly or have a long maturity. This liquidity and \nmaturity transformation can create an incentive for investors to withdraw funds quickly in \nadverse situations. Facing such withdrawals, financial institutions may need to sell assets \nquickly at “fire sale” prices, thereby incurring losses and potentially becoming insolvent, as \nwell as causing additional price declines that can create stress across markets and at other \ninstitutions (see Section 4, Funding Risks).\nThe Federal Reserve’s monitoring framework also tracks domestic and international develop-\nments to identify near-term risks—that is, plausible adverse developments or shocks that could \nstress the U.S. financial system. The analysis of these risks focuses on assessing how such \npotential shocks may spread through the U.S. financial system, given our current assessment of \nvulnerabilities.\nWhile this framework provides a systematic way to assess financial stability, some potential \nrisks may be novel or difficult to quantify and therefore are not captured by the current approach. \nGiven these complications, we rely on ongoing research by the Federal Reserve staff, academ-\nics, and other experts to improve our measurement of existing vulnerabilities and to keep pace \nwith changes in the financial system that could create new forms of vulnerabilities or add to \nexisting ones.\n\t\nPurpose and Framework\t\nvii\nFederal Reserve actions to promote the resilience of the \nfinancial system\nThe assessment of financial vulnerabilities informs Federal Reserve actions to promote the resil-\nience of the financial system. The Federal Reserve works with other domestic agencies directly \nand through the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor risks to financial stability and to \nundertake supervisory and regulatory efforts to mitigate the risks and consequences of financial \ninstability.\nActions taken by the Federal Reserve to promote the resilience of the financial system include \nits supervision and regulation of financial institutions. In the aftermath of the 2007–09 financial \ncrisis, these actions have included requirements for more and higher-quality capital, an inno-\nvative stress-testing regime, and new liquidity regulations applied to the largest banks in the \nUnited States. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s assessment of financial vulnerabilities informs \ndecisions regarding the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The CCyB is designed to increase \nthe resilience of large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal \nlosses and to promote a more sustainable supply of credit over the economic cycle.\n1\nOverview\nThis report reviews vulnerabilities affecting the stability of the U.S. financial system related to \nvaluation pressures, borrowing by businesses and households, financial-sector leverage, and \nfunding risks. It also highlights several near-term risks that, if realized, could interact with these \nvulnerabilities. This report reflects market conditions and data as of April 11, 2025.\nOverview of financial system vulnerabilities\nLeverage in the \nﬁnancial sector\nFunding risks\nBorrowing by businesses \nand households\nAsset valuations\n• Despite declines in \nasset prices amid \nsigniﬁcant market\nvolatility, valuations \nremain high across \na range of markets \nincluding equities and \nresidential real estate.\n• Liquidity in Treasury \nand equity markets\nwas low and worsened \nfurther in April, though\nmarket functioning \nremained orderly.\n• Transaction-based \nprices for commercial \nproperties have been\nﬂat recently, but a \nsizable number of \nborrowers will need\nto reﬁnance maturing\nloans in the next \nfew years.\n• Vulnerabilities\nfrom business and \nhousehold debt \nremained moderate, \nas debt levels\nadjusted for inﬂation \nwere stable.\n• The ability of \nbusinesses to \nservice their debt \ngenerally improved \neven as leverage\nremained elevated.\n• Household debt was \nat modest levels\nrelative to gross\ndomestic product \nand mostly owed by \nborrowers with strong\ncredit histories.\n• Auto and credit card \nloan delinquencies\nremained above \npre-pandemic levels.\n• The banking system\nremained sound \nand resilient, with \nregulatory capital \nratios approaching\nor exceeding\nhistorical highs.\n• Fair value losses on \nﬁxed-rate assets were\nstill sizable for some\nbanks and continued \nto be sensitive to \nﬂuctuations in \ninterest rates.\n• Broker-dealer leverage \nhas been low, though in \nApril heightened client \ndemand has reportedly \nincreased balance \nsheet pressures for \nsome dealers.\n• Hedge fund leverage\nwas at or near its \nhighest level since \n2013, though it likely \ndecreased as hedge \nfunds unwound some\npositions in early April.\n• Funding markets were \nresilient through early \nApril’s market volatility.\n• Most domestic banks \nmaintained high \nlevels of liquid assets \nand stable funding, \nand their reliance on \nuninsured deposits\nremained well below\nthe elevated levels\nseen in 2022 and \nearly 2023.\n• Vulnerabilities in \nprime money market\nfunds have declined\nsomewhat in the past \nyear as reforms for \nthese funds went fully \ninto effect, but other \ncash-management \nvehicles with structural \nvulnerabilities\ncontinued to grow.\n• Nontraditional \nliabilities at life \ninsurers are at the \nupper end of their \nhistorical distribution.\n2\t\nFinancial Stability Report\nA summary of the developments in the four broad categories of vulnerabilities since the  \nNovember 2024 Financial Stability Report (FSR) is as follows:\n1.\tAsset valuations. Asset valuations are notable. Prior to early April’s market volatility, the \nratio of equity prices to earnings had remained near the high end of its historical range and \nan estimate of the equity premium—the compensation for risk in equity markets—remained \nwell below average. Even after recent declines in equity prices, prices remained high relative \nto analysts’ earnings forecasts, which adjust more slowly than market prices. Treasury yields \nacross maturities remained at the higher end of their levels since 2008. Spreads between \nyields on corporate bonds and those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were at \nmoderate levels compared to their history, despite recent increases. Liquidity across many \nfinancial markets remained low through the end of March and deteriorated further in April, \nbut market functioning was generally orderly. In U.S. property markets, home prices remained \nelevated, and the ratio of house prices to rents continued to be near the highest levels on \nrecord. Transaction-based price indexes (adjusted for inflation) for commercial real estate \n(CRE) properties showed some signs of stabilization, though vulnerabilities due to upcoming \nrefinancing needs remain (see Section 1, Asset Valuations).\n2.\tBorrowing by businesses and households. Vulnerabilities from business and household \ndebt remained moderate. Total debt of businesses and households as a fraction of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) continued to trend down to its lowest level in the past two decades. \nIndicators of business leverage remained elevated relative to historical levels, and private \ncredit arrangements continued to grow. Nonetheless, measures of the ability of businesses \nto service their debt have been stable and within typical ranges, though a sustained decline \nin earnings could put some vulnerable business borrowers at risk. Household debt relative \nto GDP is subdued relative to recent history. Most household debt is owed by borrowers \nwith strong credit histories who are well positioned to meet their payment obligations given \nfixed-rate mortgage debt carrying low interest rates and debt service ratios slightly below \npre-pandemic levels. That said, delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans are above pre-\npandemic levels, particularly for borrowers with non-prime credit scores, a large share of whom \nhave low to moderate incomes (see Section 2, Borrowing by Businesses and Households).\n3.\tLeverage in the financial sector. Vulnerabilities associated with financial leverage remained \nnotable. The banking sector remained sound and resilient overall, and most banks continued \nto report capital levels well above regulatory requirements. Fair value losses on fixed-\nrate assets were still sizable for some banks and continued to be sensitive to changes in \ninterest rates. Further, some banks, insurers, and securitization vehicles continued to have \nconcentrated exposures to CRE. Bank credit commitments to nonbank financial institutions \n(NBFIs) continued to increase. (Improvements to the methodology for measuring these \ncommitments are discussed in the box “Changes in the Classification of Nonbank Financial \nInstitutions.”) Indicators suggested that hedge fund leverage was at or near the highest level in \nthe past decade and concentrated in larger hedge funds. More recently, a number of leveraged \n\t\nOverview\t\n3\ninvestors have unwound positions amid heightened volatility or in the course of meeting margin \ncalls, including hedge funds that participate in relative value trades. Broker-dealer leverage \nhas been near historical lows. Dealer intermediation in Treasury markets hit record highs in the \nfirst quarter of 2025, and heightened client demand in early April reportedly increased balance \nsheet pressures for some dealers (see Section 3, Leverage in the Financial Sector). \n4.\tFunding risks. Funding risks have declined over the course of the past year to a moderate  \nlevel—broadly in line with historical norms. Aggregate runnable money-like liabilities remained \nnear their historical median and represent a persistent vulnerability (discussed in the box \n“Runnables:  An Indicator of Aggregate Run-Related Vulnerabilities in the Economy”). Banks \nhave significantly reduced their reliance on uninsured deposits from peaks in 2022 and early \n2023. Vulnerabilities in prime money market funds (MMFs) have declined over the past year. \nHowever, other cash-management vehicles with similar vulnerabilities continued to grow. \nAdditionally, bond and loan funds that hold assets that can become illiquid in times of stress \nand are therefore susceptible to large redemptions experienced somewhat elevated outflows \nin early April (see Section 4, Funding Risks).\nThis report also discusses potential near-term risks, based in part on the most frequently cited \nrisks to U.S. financial stability as gathered from outreach to a wide range of researchers, academ-\nics, and market contacts conducted from February to early April (discussed in the box “Survey of \nSalient Risks to Financial Stability”). The most frequently cited topics in the responses, the vast \nmajority of which were received before April 2, were risks to global trade, policy uncertainty, and \nU.S. fiscal debt sustainability. A number of respondents also cited persistent inflation and correc-\ntions in asset markets as salient risks.\nSurvey of salient risks to the financial system\nSurvey respondents cited several risks to the U.S. financial system and the broader global economy.

Nonethe-\nless, prices remained high rela­tive to fundamentals across a range of markets.\nTreasury market liquidity continued to be low by historical standards heading into April. In early \nApril, yields on Treasury securities exhibited considerable volatility, which contributed to a deteri-\noration in market liquidity. Nonetheless, amid this increase in volatility, trading remained orderly, \nand markets continued to function without serious disruption. Treasury yields have remained \nabove their average levels since 2008.\nEquity markets have been turbulent since the previous report. After significant gains in late 2024 \nand early 2025, equity market price indexes experienced notable swings beginning in early March, \nwith the largest moves occurring after April 2. On net through April 11, equity prices fell more \nthan 6 percent from the previous FSR. Despite this decline, equity prices remained high relative \nto forecasted earnings, which adjust more slowly than market prices. Corporate bond spreads \nhave widened significantly but have stayed at or below their historical medians, while corporate \nbond issuance slowed considerably, consistent with periods of elevated volatility.\nCRE markets showed some signs of stabilizing prices and fundamentals, although the potential \nfor distressed commercial property sales remains if CRE borrowers who need to refinance their \nmortgages are unable to do so. In residential real estate markets, prices relative to fundamentals \ncontinued to be well above their historical averages.\nTable 1.1 shows the sizes of the asset markets discussed in this section. The two largest asset \nmarkets are those for equities and residential real estate, which are substantially larger than the \nnext two markets, Treasury securities and CRE. The table also shows recent and historical growth \nrates for each asset class, because assets experiencing strong growth can be a sign of high risk \nappetite in that sector.\nTreasury yields remained high amid heightened volatility\nTreasury yields across maturities continued to be well above their average levels over the past \n15 years (figure 1.1). Since the November report, the Treasury yield curve has steepened as \n6\t\nFinancial Stability Report\nTable 1.1.

Average annual growth of leveraged\nloans is from 2000 to 2024:Q4, as this market was fairly small before then.\n2 One-year growth of commercial real estate prices is from December 2023 to December 2024, and average annual\ngrowth is from December 1999 to December 2024. Both growth rates are calculated from equal-weighted nominal\nprices deﬂated using the consumer price index (CPI).\n3 One-year growth of residential real estate prices is from December 2023 to December 2024, and average annual\ngrowth is from December 1998 to December 2024.

A model-based estimate of the nominal Treasury term \npremium—a measure of the compensation that investors require to hold longer-term Treasury \nsecurities rather than shorter-term ones—fell a bit and remained near the top of its range \nsince 2010, though also near its longer-term historical median (figure 1.2). Moves in Treasury \nyields were sizable in early April. Unlike previous flight-to-safety episodes, Treasury prices fell \nalongside steep declines in equity prices amid heightened uncertainty. Interest rate volatility \nimplied by interest rate swaps was elevated by historical standards and increased further in early \nApril (figure 1.3).\nEquity markets declined, on net, amid a large increase in volatility\nMeasures of equity valuations were stretched by historical standards through March. The \nP/E ratio, defined as the ratio of equity prices to expected 12-month earnings, remained well \nabove its historical median (figure 1.4). The difference between the forward P/E ratio and the \nreal 10-year Treasury yield—a measure of the additional return that investors require for holding \nstocks relative to risk-free bonds (the equity premium)—remained well below its historical median \n(figure 1.5).2 Equity prices had experienced notable swings in March before declining substan-\ntially in early April, with various indexes concluding the week of April 7 somewhat below their \nvalues as of the November report. Option-implied equity market volatility rose dramatically and \nreached levels not seen since March 2020 (figure 1.6, black line). These developments suggest \nthat investors demanded increased compensation for holding stocks. Despite the recent decline, \nprices remained high relative to analysts’ earnings forecast, which update more slowly than \nmarket prices.\n2\t This estimate is constructed based on expected corporate earnings for 12 months ahead.\nFigure 1.2.

In the second half of \n2024, the share of deep junk corporate bond issuance—the fraction of total non-investment- \ngrade issuance accounted for by bonds rated B- or lower—declined from already low levels.  \nMarket-based forecasts of one-year-ahead default probabilities of nonfinancial firms (a forward- \nlooking indicator of credit quality) rose somewhat to elevated levels by historical standards.\nSince the last report, the average spread on leveraged loans in the secondary market increased \nto around the 40th percentile of its historical distribution since 2009 (figure 1.10). Leveraged \nloan issuance also slowed substantially.

Low liquidity can amplify the vol-\natility of asset prices and result in larger price moves in response to shocks. Similarly, increased \nvolatility can dampen liquidity because liquidity providers may become more cautious in providing \nquotes. In extreme cases, low liquidity can threaten continued market functioning, leading to a \nsituation in which participants are unable to trade without incurring a significant cost.\nTreasury market liquidity is particularly important because of the key role these securities play \nin the financial system. Before April, various measures of Treasury market liquidity, including two \ndifferent measures of market depth in the most liquid on-the-run segment, indicated that liquidity \nremained low by historical standards (figures 1.11 and 1.12). In April, measures of market liquid-\nity declined further amid a notable rise in trading volumes and volatility, but Treasury markets  \ncontinued to function without signs of the severe strains that have emerged in some past  \nstress episodes. \nFigure 1.11.

Some firms in this group may be less well positioned to weather a large shock. Based on \navailable data, the ICR for the median firm in this category continued its downward trend over the \nprevious few years and was slightly below its pre-pandemic level, as higher interest rates have \ncontributed to reduced earnings and increased the cost of debt servicing. The average ICR at \nissuance for private credit borrowers, which comprise almost exclusively small and middle-market \nprivate firms, increased but remained low around a value of 2, indicating debt-servicing capacity \nin the range of below-investment-grade public firms.

When measured relative to \nmarket prices for house values (figure 2.10, \nthe blue line), outstanding mortgage balances \nhave remained subdued. Outstanding mort-\ngage loan balances relative to an estimate of \nhome values from a model using rents and \nother market fundamentals were somewhat \nhigher but remained far below earlier peaks \n(figure 2.10, the black line). The overall mort-\ngage delinquency rate remained at the lower end of its historical distribution in the second half of \n2024, while the share of mortgage balances in loss-mitigation programs increased, albeit from \nlow levels (figure 2.11). Delinquency rates remained subdued due to large home equity cushions \n(figure 2.12) and strong underwriting standards.\nNew mortgage extensions rose slightly for borrowers with a prime credit score (the group with \nthe largest share) in the fourth quarter of 2024 but declined slightly for borrowers with near-\nprime or subprime credit scores (figure 2.13). In the second quarter of 2024, the early payment \ndelinquency rate—the share of balances becoming delinquent within one year of mortgage \norigination—remained somewhat above the median of its historical distribution. \nFigure 2.9.

The increase in subprime auto loan delin-\nquencies over the past couple of years may be due to higher car prices and higher interest rates, \ncombined with loosened underwriting standards and elevated loan maturities.\nAggregate inflation-adjusted credit card balances grew moderately for all borrower types over \nthe second half of 2024 (figure 2.17). Credit card delinquency rates inched down in the fourth \nquarter of 2024 after reaching their highest level since 2010 in the previous quarter following \nlooser underwriting standards during the pandemic era and large growth in real revolving credit \n(figure 2.18).

Measures of regulatory capital for banks \nincreased over the second half of 2024. However, fair value losses on fixed-rate assets  \nremained sizable for certain banks, while some banks continued to have concentrated exposures \nto CRE loans.\nOutside the banking sector, leverage at broker-dealers decreased in the fourth quarter of 2024 \nand stayed near historically low levels. However, the potential for strains on dealers’ intermedia-\ntion capacity during periods of market stress remained a vulnerability to Treasury markets. Life \ninsurers’ leverage remained at the upper end of its historical distribution, and life insurers con-\ntinued to hold a significant share of illiquid and risky assets. While hedge funds’ leverage rose to \nhistorical highs in the third quarter of 2024 and remained concentrated among the largest hedge \nfunds, it likely decreased in early April as some hedge funds unwound leveraged positions amid \nheightened market volatility.\nTable 3.1 shows the sizes and growth rates of assets of financial institutions discussed in \nthis section.\nBanks maintained historically high levels of regulatory capital, \nthough fair value losses in fixed-rate assets remained sizable\nThe common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a regulatory risk-based measure of bank capital adequacy, \ncontinued to rise since the last report. This increase was primarily driven by strong retained earn-\nings, bringing these ratios across all bank sizes to the upper end of their range from 2010 to 2024 \n(figure 3.1). As of the end of 2024, measures of bank profitability continued to improve and were \naround the median of their historical distributions. Banks’ average interest rate on interest earning \nassets remained well above the average interest rate paid on liabilities, supporting net interest \nmargins (figure 3.2). Earnings for the largest banks were reportedly robust in the first quarter of \n2025, though early earnings calls highlighted elevated economic uncertainty and downside risk, \nwith some banks increasing loan-loss reserves to buffer against a potential increase in defaults.\nHigher interest rates continued to reduce the fair value of banks’ fixed-rate assets. At the end of \n2024, the fair values of banks’ available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios were \nbelow their book values by $182 billion and $297 billion, respectively (figure 3.3). The fair value of \nbanks’ securities holdings remained sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n28\t\nFinancial Stability Report\nFigure 3.1.

While this ratio shares similarities with the CET1 ratio—as both exclude intangible items \nlike goodwill from capital—there are important differences between the two. Unlike the CET1 \nratio, the tangible common equity ratio does not factor in the riskiness of assets, but it does \ninclude fair value declines on AFS securities for all banks. While the tangible common equity ratio \nincreased across all bank categories in the second half of 2024, it remained below its average \nlevel over the past decade (figure 3.4).\nTable 3.1.

Such an increase was consistent with high Treasury issuance and reports from \nmarket participants highlighting reduced demand from other Treasury investors. While dealers’ \nintermediation capacity remains adequate for market functioning in normal times, balance sheet \npressures could constrain dealers’ ability to intermediate in Treasury markets during periods of \nmarket stress. Heightened client demand in early April reportedly increased balance sheet pres-\nsures for some dealers.\nIn the March 2025 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), \ndealers reported a slight easing in terms for securities financing transactions and over-the-\ncounter derivatives since November.8 Over the same period, their clients’ use of financial lever-\nage remained unchanged on net. Additionally, one-fifth of dealers noted a relaxation in collateral \nspreads for agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CMBS. The March SCOOS \nalso included special questions focusing on dealers’ and their clients’ practices in Treasury repur-\nchase agreement (repo) markets, specifically regarding cross-margining, which allows market par-\nticipants to transfer margin from accounts with an excess of margin to accounts with insufficient \nmargin. While most dealers indicated that their clients engage in both Treasury repo and Treasury \nfutures or interest rate derivatives transactions, only a small fraction reported significant use of \ncross-margining agreements for these trades.\nInsurers’ leverage increased, and they continued to invest in risky \nand illiquid assets\nWhile leverage at life insurers remained around the 85th percentile of its historical distribution \nover the second half of 2024, leverage at property and casualty insurers remained near the lower \nend of its historical distribution (figure 3.10). Life insurers continued to take additional credit  \nand liquidity risk by allocating a growing share of their portfolios to riskier and less liquid assets, \nsuch as leveraged loans, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), high-yield corporate bonds, \nprivately placed corporate bonds, and alternative investments. Additionally, as major holders of \nCMBS, life insurers could face valuation pressures if commercial property values experience a \nsignificant decline.\n8\t The SCOOS is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/scoos.htm.\n\t\nLeverage in the Financial Sector\t\n33\nHedge funds’ leverage has likely decreased from historically high \nlevels due to repositioning and unwinding levered trades in April\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the most recent quarter for which the Securities and Exchange  \nCommission’s form PF data are available, hedge funds’ leverage reached historical highs and \nremained heavily concentrated among the largest funds (figure 3.11 and figure 3.12). According to \ndata from the March SCOOS, hedge funds’ leverage remained largely unchanged between mid- \nNovember 2024 and mid-February 2025 (figure 3.13). More recently, however, hedge fund lever-\nage likely declined amid elevated market volatility. This reported decrease reflects a partial \nunwinding of leveraged positions by some hedge funds. Hedge fund repositioning and deleverag-\ning may have contributed to the recent market volatility, both in equities and risky assets as well \nas in some longer-dated Treasury securities.\nFigure 3.10.

Credit \nperformance across securitized products backed by riskier loan collateral showed continued signs \nof deterioration. This decline in credit performance was particularly pronounced in CRE-related \nsecuritizations, with prime auto and credit card asset-backed securities (ABS) also experiencing \nsigns of deterioration.\n9\t Securitization allows financial institutions to bundle loans or other financial assets and sell claims on the cash flows \ngenerated by these assets as tradable securities, much like bonds. By funding assets with debt issued by invest-\nment funds known as special purpose entities (SPEs), securitization can add leverage to the financial system, in part \nbecause SPEs are generally subject to regulatory regimes, such as risk retention rules, that are less stringent than \nbanks’ regulatory capital requirements. Examples of the resulting securities include CLOs (predominantly backed by \nleveraged loans), asset-backed securities (often backed by credit card and auto debt), CMBS, and RMBS.\nFigure 3.14.

Growth \nin some areas, such as commitments to open-end investment funds, special purpose entities, \nand securitization vehicles, was strong (figure 3.16). As outlined in the box “Changes in the \nClassification of Nonbank Financial Institutions,” there have been a number of improvements to \nthe methodology for the identification of different types of NBFI borrowers. One result of these \nimprovements is that a substantial amount of loans to borrowers previously classified in catego-\nries such as “Other financial vehicles” have been identified as private equity (PE) firms, business \ndevelopment companies (BDCs), and private credit (PC) funds. Overall, bank lending to NBFIs \nis not significantly concentrated in any one sector, most commitments are rated investment \ngrade, and these loans traditionally have had delinquency rates lower than loans to nonfinancial \nbusinesses.\nFigure 3.15.

Changes in the Classiﬁ cation of Nonbank Financial \nInstitutions\nSince the November report, the methodology for identifying bank credit commitments to NBFIs has \nbeen updated. As part of the change, new data on company names from various data vendors now \nsupplement bank-reported North American Industry Classifi cation System codes. The estimates now \nincorporate data from additional bank-holding companies that recently started reporting Fr Y-14Q \ninformation as part of the annual supervisory stress test. As a result of this change, total commit-\nment amounts to NBFIs, shown in fi gure 3.15, are $124 billion higher, implying a total of $2.3 trillion \nfor 2024:Q4.\nrelative to the previous classifi cation, loan commitment amounts identifi ed in the combined pE, \nBDC, and pC sector and in the real estate investment trusts (rEITs) sector are higher by $243 billion \nand $158 billion, respectively, in 2024:Q4. The higher level of commitments to pE/BDC/pC is mainly \ndriven by improved name-matching and reclassifi cations from the “Other fi nancial vehicles” category. \nThe higher level of commitments to rEITs is mostly driven by reclassifi cations from “real estate lend-\ners and lessors.”\nWhile the improvements to the methodology have resulted in a signifi cant upward revision to the \nestimated level of loan commitments to pE/BDC/pC and rEITs, estimated historical growth rates \nremained roughly unchanged relative to the growth rates reported using the previous methodology.\n37\n4\nFunding Risks\nOver the past year, vulnerabilities from funding risks have declined to \na level in line with historical norms\nFunding risks for most banks remained near historical norms. Uninsured deposits as a share of \nbank funding have declined significantly from their 2022 peak, though some banks’ reliance on \npotentially less-stable forms of funding remained high. On the asset side, large banks subject to \nthe liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) maintained sound levels of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA).\nMMFs and other cash-management vehicles continued to be vulnerable to runs, as they allow \ndaily investor redemptions while investing in assets with a degree of credit risk and limited \nsecondary-market trading, which can lead to strains in stress episodes. Vulnerabilities in prime \nand tax-exempt MMFs have diminished as reforms went into effect and assets under manage-\nment (AUM) in institutional prime funds, the most run-prone segment, declined. However, other \ncash-management vehicles continued to grow.\nSome open-end bond mutual funds remained susceptible to large outflows, as they allow daily \nredemptions while holding assets that might become illiquid in times of stress. Meanwhile, life \ninsurers continued to face funding risk owing to their reliance on nontraditional liabilities in combi-\nnation with an increasing share of investments in less-liquid assets.\nOverall, estimated runnable money-like financial liabilities grew 8.2 percent over the past year, \nexceeding $23 trillion, driven by growth in MMFs and repos. As a share of GDP, runnable liabilities \nremained near their historical median of around 78 percent (table 4.1 and figure 4.1). The box \n“Runnables: An Indicator of Aggregate Run-Related Vulnerabilities in the Economy” provides an \noverview of their composition, historical trends, and recent developments.\nMost banks maintained high levels of liquidity, and their funding \nsources have stabilized over the past year\nAggregate liquidity in the banking system remained sound, as HQLA relative to total assets \nremained above pre-pandemic levels (figure 4.2). Many U.S. G-SIBs held a significant portion of \ntheir HQLA in HTM securities, primarily long-duration agency mortgage-backed securities, whose \nmarket values continued to be well below their book values. Securities held in HTM accounts \nare accounted at book value when used in the calculation of regulatory capital and book equity, \nbut they are valued at fair value for LCR purposes; therefore, fluctuations in the value of these \nsecurities can affect banks’ LCR levels. HTM securities can be pledged at the Federal Reserve’s \ndiscount window or in repos at their market value.\n38\t\nFinancial Stability Report\nTable 4.1.

Runnables: An Indicator of Aggregate Run-Related \nVulnerabilities in the Economy1\nruns can precipitate severe strains in short-term funding markets. As such, short-term uninsured \nliabilities that are susceptible to runs, or “runnables,” serve as a key metric for assessing aggregate \nrun-related vulnerabilities in the economy.2 This box provides an overview of runnables, including their \ncomposition, historical trends, and recent developments.\n1 This box provides explanations and analyses for figure 4.1, which shows runnable money-like liabilities as a share of GDp.\n2 The concept of “runnables” was introduced in Jack Bao, Josh David, and Song Han (2015), “The runnables,” FEDS \nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal reserve System, September 3), https://www.federalreserve.gov/\neconresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/the-runnables-20150903.html.\n3 In the example above, this approach results in total runnables of $20,000, reflecting both the MMF shares and the Cp \nfunding.\nConcept of runnables\nrunnables play a vital role in the economy by offering investors cash-management options and provid-\ning short-term funding to businesses, governments, and fi nancial institutions. Their total outstanding \nvolume amounts to roughly 80 percent of U.S. GDp, highlighting their signifi cant presence in the fi nan-\ncial system.\nHowever, these liabilities also pose signifi cant systemic risk due to their susceptibility to runs, in \nwhich investors stop providing funding by redeeming shares, withdrawing deposits, or refusing to roll \nover short-term debts. Such runs have contributed to several episodes of fi nancial stress over the \npast two decades. Hence, monitoring the aggregate size and composition of runnables is critical for \nassessing vulnerabilities stemming from funding risk.\nEstimation approach for runnables\nShort-term funding markets include both funding instruments—such as repos and commercial paper \n(Cp)—and investment vehicles like MMFs that invest in those instruments. Instruments and vehicles \nmay overlap in providing funding. For example, an investor purchasing $10,000 in MMF shares may \nindirectly provide that funding to a bank if the MMF uses the proceeds to purchase Cp issued by the \nbank. runs can occur in either segment of this funding chain: The MMF can suffer a run if investors \nrapidly redeem shares, and a Cp issuer can experience a run if MMFs suddenly stop rolling over its \nmaturing Cp. Furthermore, such events are often linked, as redemptions from an MMF may compel it \nto curtail the fi nancing provided to its borrowers, amplifying systemic stress.\nThus, to quantify the aggregate size of runnables, the sum of the outstanding amounts of all runnable \ncomponents is used, rather than a net amount.3 Conceptually, this aggregate measure is designed \nto capture all types of short-term liabilities that could be subject to runs. To account for inﬂ ation and \neconomic growth over time, runnable liabilities are scaled by nominal U.S. GDp.\nComponents of runnables and their vulnerabilities\nWhile runnables play a vital role in the fi nancial system, in the past two decades most have experi-\nenced runs or run-like events—some of which stabilized only after government intervention.\nDomestic MMF shares are used for cash management by both institutional and retail investors, \nwhile MMFs provide short-term funding to fi nancial and nonfi nancial fi rms as well as governments. \nprime MMFs, which bear credit risk, suffered industry-wide runs in September 2008 and again in \nMarch 2020. Cp is a key source of short-term funding for large corporations and fi nancial institu-\ntions. However, during crises, issuers have struggled to roll over maturing Cp, leading to sharp spikes \n(continued)\n40\t\nFinancial Stability Report\n40\ninfunding costs and market freezes. repos are short-term, secured loans that serve as a key funding \nsource for broker-dealers and leveraged investors, who often depend on continuous rollovers. repo \nmarkets experienced major disruptions in 2008, with funding volumes contracting abruptly. Securities \nlending is economically similar to repo, with securities lenders typically reinvesting cash collateral in \nshort-term instruments. Some of these reinvestments came under stress in 2008, which strained \nsecurities lenders’ ability to return cash collateral on demand. Uninsured bank deposits—those \nexceeding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit—are an important funding source \nfor some banks but have been vulnerable to rapid withdrawals during multiple periods of stress.\nThe coverage of runnables has expanded notably since 2015, partly due to improved data availability.4 \nThe measure now also includes dollar-denominated offshore MMFs, bank-sponsored short-term invest-\nment funds, local government investment pools, private liquidity funds, and ultrashort bond funds—\nmany of which invest in similar markets as domestic MMFs. Most of these runnable vehicles have \ngrown steadily over the past decade, and many experienced notable stresses during crises. More \nrecently, innovation in short-term funding markets has given rise to new forms of runnables, particu-\nlarly stablecoins. As fi nancial innovations continue, the list of runnables will likely expand further.\n4 The new data series discussed in this paragraph, including stablecoins, are incorporated in the “Other” category of figure 4.1. \nThis “Other” category also includes federal funds, variable-rate demand obligations, and funding-agreement-backed securi-\nties. Due to data limitations, the size of some of these runnables may be underestimated.\nEvolution of runnables\nThe usefulness of runnables as an indicator of aggregate fi nancial vulnerability was evident in the \nyears leading up to 2007, when their share of GDp reached record highs—driven largely by the expan-\nsion of nonbank fi nancial intermediaries and their heavy use of short-term funding markets. These \nelevated levels signaled heightened run risks.\nThat fragility materialized during the 2007–09 fi nancial crisis, as several key components of runnables \nexperienced damaging runs. The most prominent include the run on asset-backed commercial paper \n(ABCp), the run on prime MMFs, and the freeze in the triparty repo market. Following the crisis, total \nrunnables declined sharply relative to GDp, as market participants pulled back from certain funding \nmarkets—such as repos, securities lending, and ABCp—while uninsured deposits temporarily shrank \ndue to expanded deposit insurance coverage.\nUninsured deposits returned to elevated levels in 2013 after the expiration of temporary deposit \ninsurance expansions and saw another boost in 2020 amid the pandemic. These increases not \nonly markedly contributed to the growth of aggregate runnables but also were a factor in the 2023 \nregional bank crisis, during which runs on uninsured deposits led to the failure of several banks.\nAlthough uninsured deposits have declined in the aftermath of the 2023 turmoil, the overall volume \nof runnables remains substantial. runnables are a key asset for investors and funding source for bor-\nrowers, and the liquidity mismatch associated with runnables contributes to inherent vulnerabilities in \nthe fi nancial system.\nBox 4.1—continued\n\t\nFunding Risks\t\n41\nBanks’ funding structure was little changed at the end of 2024 relative to the end of 2023. The \nshare of uninsured deposits relative to total bank funding remained well below the elevated levels \nseen in 2022 and early 2023. Large banks adjusted to lower uninsured deposits by increasing \ntheir reliance on short-term non-deposit wholesale funding sources, such as repos, and regional \nand community banks generally became more reliant on brokered and reciprocal deposits  \n(figure 4.3). While reciprocal deposits are fully insured, they are more expensive than traditional \ncore insured deposits and may not be as stable during times of stress.\nMoney market funds and other cash-management vehicles remained \nsusceptible to runs\nVulnerabilities in prime MMFs have declined somewhat in the past year and AUM in institutional \nprime MMFs—historically, the most vulnerable segment—shrank substantially. Total prime assets \ndeclined only slightly over the past year, as retail prime MMFs attracted sizable inflows.\nFigure 4.2.

More than 80 percent of MMF assets are in funds that hold only U.S. government \nsecurities and repo backed by them.\nOther cash-management vehicles, such as dollar-denominated offshore MMFs and short-term \ninvestment funds, also invest in money market instruments and engage in liquidity transforma-\ntion. Estimated aggregate AUM of these vehicles remained at $2.1 trillion, unchanged from the \nNovember report, with roughly $1 trillion to $2 trillion of that amount in vehicles with portfolios \nsimilar to those of prime MMFs.10\nMany cash-management vehicles—including retail and government MMFs, offshore MMFs, and \nshort-term investment funds—seek to maintain stable net asset values that are typically rounded \nto $1.00. If short-term interest rates rise sharply or portfolio assets lose value for other reasons, \nthe market values of these funds may fall below their rounded share prices, potentially triggering \nlarge redemptions and destabilizing short-term funding markets.\nStablecoins continued to grow and remained vulnerable to runs\nStablecoin assets—digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national \ncurrency or another reference asset—continued to grow.11 By early April, the total market capital-\nization of stablecoins reached approximately $235 billion, above the previous high observed in \nApril 2022 before Terra’s collapse (figure 4.5).\n10\tCash-management vehicles included in this total are dollar-denominated offshore MMFs, short-term investment funds, \nprivate liquidity funds, ultrashort bond mutual funds, and local government investment pools.\n11\tStablecoins are typically backed by a pool of “reserve” assets that include Treasury bills and other short-term instru-\nments, but some stablecoin reserve assets also include loans and other digital assets.\nFigure 4.4.

As of \nthe fourth quarter of 2024, mutual funds held approximately $1.4 trillion in corporate bonds—\naccounting for nearly 14 percent of corporate bonds outstanding (figure 4.6). In early 2025, total \nAUM of the subcategories of mutual funds holding high-yield bonds and bank loans—both of \nwhich tend to hold riskier and less liquid securities—increased modestly, while net inflows into \nthese funds remained relatively subdued (figure 4.7 and figure 4.8).12 In early April, amid height-\nened market volatility, outflows from bank loan and high-yield bond mutual funds were somewhat \nelevated.\n12\tAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, mutual funds held approximately 10 percent and 18 percent of high-yield and bank \nloans outstanding, respectively.\nFigure 4.5.

CCPs also maintained high levels of prefunded mutualized resources.13 Elevated ini-\ntial margins and ample overall prefunded resources lower the risk faced by CCPs to the potential \ndefault by a clearing member or market participant. This, in turn, reduces the possibility of large \nliquidity demands from a CCP to its credit providers (usually banks). More recently, CCPs operated \nnormally as transaction volumes across cleared products grew in early April. However, the con-\ncentration of clients’ collateral at the largest clearing members remains a vulnerability, as such \n13\tPrefunded resources represent financial assets, including cash and securities, transferred by the clearing members \nto the CCP to cover that CCP’s potential credit exposure in case of default by one or more clearing members. These \nprefunded resources are held as initial margin and prefunded mutualized resources, which builds the resilience of \nCCPs to the possible default of a clearing member or market participant.\n\t\nFunding Risks\t\n45\nconcentration could make transferring client positions to other clearing members challenging if it \nwere ever necessary.14\nLife insurers’ reliance on nontraditional liabilities for funding \ncontinued to increase\nLife insurers continued to increase their reliance on nontraditional liabilities for funding, including \nfunding-agreement-backed securities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and cash received \nthrough repos and securities lending transactions (figure 4.9). These liabilities can create liquidity \nrisk through the inability to roll over funding if the proceeds from such funding are not invested \nin assets with similar maturity profiles (figure 4.10). The combination of a growing reliance on \nnontraditional liabilities and a steady decline in the liquidity of life insurers’ assets could make it \nchallenging for life insurers to meet a sudden rise in withdrawals or other claims.\n14\tIf a clearing member were to default, its client positions would need to be transferred. However, transferring these \npositions could be difficult if they are large. Given that a significant portion of client positions is currently con-\ncentrated with a few clearing members, such a transfer would likely be challenging if one of these members were \nto default.\nFigure 4.9.

As captured in the box “Survey of Salient Risks to Financial Stability,” significantly \nfewer respondents in recent outreach noted risks associated with the continued geopolitical \nconflict in the Middle East and Russia’s war against Ukraine than had done so in the fall survey. \nInstead, the most cited risks were focused on global trade, policy uncertainty, and U.S. debt \nsustainability.\nThe following discussion considers possible interactions of existing domestic vulnerabilities with \nthree potential near-term risks.\nA U.S. slowdown, particularly if accompanied by higher interest \nrates, could pose risks for the wider economy as well as financial \ninstitutions\nA slowdown in economic activity in the United States could have wide-ranging financial and \neconomic effects and prompt further declines in asset prices. Adverse dynamics could be ampli-\nfied if interest rates rose at the same time. In the near term, higher interest rates could raise \nconsumer borrowing costs and strain household budgets, increasing the potential for delinquen-\ncies. Debt-servicing costs for governments and corporations would similarly increase, which \ncould amplify existing vulnerabilities linked to high leverage and upcoming refinancing needs. \nCollectively, these factors could lead to fair value losses on fixed-rate securities among financial \nintermediaries, which, in turn, could reduce the supply of credit to the economy, further weighing \non economic activity.\nA marked slowdown in global economic growth could expose \nexisting financial vulnerabilities\nA pronounced economic slowdown in major advanced and emerging economies could weigh on \ninvestor, business, and consumer sentiment and prompt a broader pullback from riskier assets or \nthose with elevated valuations, increasing volatility in financial markets and raising the potential \nfor market dislocations. Weaker-than-expected economic activity could also erode the fundamen-\ntals of some businesses and households by broadly reducing the outlook for revenue and income \ngrowth, impairing their ability to service debt and raising the potential for defaults and delinquen-\ncies. These increased credit risks could strain the balance sheets of financial intermediaries, \n48\t\nFinancial Stability Report\nwhich may restrict the supply of credit as a result. In addition, concerns about elevated public \ndebt levels and fiscal deterioration in many advanced economies may limit governments’ ability to \nrespond to weaker growth.\nCyberattacks and other cyber events could disrupt market \nfunctioning and the provision of financial services\nOver recent years, cyber events, and the risks they pose to the financial system, have been a \nrecurring concern for participants in the Federal Reserve’s market outreach surveys. In addi-\ntion to malicious cyberattacks and costly heists, non-malicious cyber events, such as software \nmalfunctions, have caused disruptions to the provision of financial services. Shocks caused by \ncyber events may propagate through complex interdependencies among financial institutions \nand market infrastructures as well as service providers, and can be further amplified by existing \nfinancial vulnerabilities. For example, a cyber event at a financial market utility may disrupt core \ninfrastructure that supports clearing and settlement, degrading market liquidity. An attack on a \nlarge financial institution could impair its ability to access or verify data, complete transactions, \nor meet obligations, posing risks for funding and depositor runs as well as fire sales. Attacks \non critical third-party providers could affect multiple institutions, with the effects of such disrup-\ntions likely to be further amplified when there is limited substitutability for the affected services. \nThrough continued interagency coordination and information sharing, U.S. government agencies \nand financial regulators are advancing efforts to further protect the financial system and financial \ninfrastructure from cyber risks.\n\t\nNear-Term Risks to the Financial System\t\n49\n49\nBox 5.1. Survey of Salient Risks to Financial Stability\nAs part of its market intelligence gathering, staff from the Federal reserve Bank of New York solicited \nviews from a wide range of contacts on risks to U.S. fi nancial stability. From February to early April, \nthe staff surveyed 22 contacts, including professionals at broker-dealers, investment funds, and \nresearch and advisory fi rms, as well as academics (fi gure A). This section is a summary of the views \nprovided by survey respondents and should not be interpreted as representing the views of the \nFederal reserve Board or the Federal reserve Bank of New York.\nrisks emanating from changes to global trade policy were the most cited risk. U.S. fi scal debt sus-\ntainability, which was the top-cited risk last fall, was slightly less noted this round. Broader policy \nuncertainty, which was often cited in the survey last fall, remained frequently cited this cycle \n(fi gure B). A correction in risk assets as well as persistent inﬂ ation were also frequently cited in this \nround. respondents also expressed concern that Treasury market functioning could become impaired \ndue to a conﬂ uence of factors.\nRisks to global trade\nConcern over changes to trade policy was the top-cited risk this cycle. While many respondents \nviewed tariffs as the key risk, some noted that the domestic economy could weather incremental tar-\niffs on imported goods with only modest disruption. respondents considered that the potential for an \nescalatory trade war could have more severe consequences.\nPolicy uncertainty\nrespondents also highlighted policy uncertainty outside of trade, including changes in government \nspending priorities and the extent of U.S. international engagement. As in the fall, the need to raise \nthe debt limit was also cited.\nU.S. fiscal debt sustainability\nContacts noted concerns that elevated Treasury supply could crowd out private investment, raise \nterm premia, and further challenge Treasury market liquidity.\nRisk asset/valuation correction\nContacts cited a correction in the price of risk assets, with elevated valuations as a notable risk.\nPersistent inflation\nrespondents continued to note the risk of persistent inﬂ ation, though not as frequently as in surveys \nover the past several years. participants highlighted that inﬂ ation could rise from tariffs and disrup-\ntions to global supply chains. Several contacts specifi cally mentioned the risk that longer-term inﬂ a-\ntion expectations could become unanchored.\nTreasury market functioning\nrespondents noted that the intermediation capacity in the Treasury market could become challenged. \nIn addition, some expressed concerns about the demand for Treasury securities from foreign inves-\ntors and how shifts in investor behavior could impact the Treasury market.\n(continued)\n50\t\nFinancial Stability Report\n50\nBox 5.1—continued\nFigure A.
